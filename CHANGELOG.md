## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New `seedHistory.ts` script for robust, date-driven seeding of weeks, games, bets, and user performance for demo and admin users.
- `deleteWeek99.ts` script to safely remove legacy week 99 and all associated data.
- Demo reset flow: DB reset, teams/users seeding, demo data seeding for robust, repeatable demos.
- All teams now seeded with valid logo URLs for consistent frontend display.
- Admin Create Game form now uses dropdowns for Home and Away Team selection, fetching teams from the backend.
- Team selection dropdowns have fully localized placeholders (Spanish/English) using the new 'select_team' translation key.
- Admin games management now displays team logos next to team names.
- User Management table now shows 0 (localized) for total winnings if no winnings exist, instead of $NaN.
- Preparation for /games page to use only real data and show all scheduled games (mock data removal and API logic update planned).

### Changed
- **Seeding:** Removed legacy week 99 logic from all seeding scripts. All week/game/bet seeding is now handled by `seedHistory.ts`.
- **Backend:**
  - `/api/weeks/current` and `/api/games/current-week` endpoints now select the current week based on `status: 'OPEN'` and a future `bettingDeadline`, ordered by `startDate` and `weekNumber` (Prisma array syntax).
  - Fixed Prisma `orderBy` usage to use array syntax, resolving console errors.
- **Frontend:**
  - Dashboard and `/bet` page now reliably display seeded data for the correct week and users.

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where dashboard and `/bet` page showed no data due to backend returning legacy week 99.
- Fixed Prisma validation errors in backend logs by correcting `orderBy` usage.
- Cleaned up `seed.ts` to only create teams and users, preventing legacy week creation.
- Dashboard and /bet pages now display correct data for demo/admin users.
- Status field normalized in frontend to handle backend casing.
- All numeric profile fields are now numbers in backend API responses.
- Removed non-existent fields from backend profile response to fix TypeScript errors.
- Improved demo seeding and DB reset flow for reliable demo data.
- Added debug logging and diagnostics for API and frontend data flow issues.
- Frontend now robustly handles backend data types and missing fields.
- Single Bets UI: Demo user can always place single bets for all games; prediction selection and highlighting now work; Place Bet button enables as expected.
- No changes to parlay or other user workflows.
- Backend/frontend userBet logic improved for demo reliability and correct bet state display.
- Admin panel: Changed all frontend GET requests for weeks from `/api/admin/weeks` to `/api/weeks` to match backend routes. This fixes a bug where game creation would fail due to 404 errors when fetching weeks.
- Admin panel: Normalized game status translation for existing games, ensuring correct display of status labels (e.g., Programado, En Vivo, Completado).
- Admin panel: Improved merging and display of mock and real games in the 'Existing Games' section.
- Admin panel: Temporarily hid the 'Weeks' tab for a cleaner UI.

## [Unreleased] - Deployment & Live Server Fixes

### Changed
- Nginx config now proxies `/api` to backend (port 3001) and all other requests to frontend (Next.js SSR, port 3000).
- PM2 process management improved: always starts both frontend and backend, checks for process existence, and uses correct process names.
- Deployment script now ensures frontend is built and started in SSR mode.
- Added health check endpoint verification after deploy.

## [Unreleased] - June 2025
### Fixed
- Resolved critical bug where admin panel and dashboard API requests returned 401/404 due to backend only checking Authorization header for JWT.
- Updated backend auth middleware to check for JWT in both Authorization header and auth_token cookie.
- Enabled cookie-parser middleware in backend.
- Audited frontend to ensure all protected API calls use the configured axios instance with baseURL: '/api'.
- Installed missing cookie-parser and types for backend build.

### Investigation
- Verified CORS, environment variables, Next.js rewrites, and cookie settings.
- Confirmed cookies were set and sent by browser but not used by backend.
- Identified duplicate/inconsistent API calls in frontend.
- Systematically tested and documented all steps before applying the fix.

### Changed
- Admin navigation for users with the admin role is now minimal: "Dashboard" and "My History" links are hidden, and "Admin Panel" is the default/leftmost view.
- Admin users are now redirected to /admin after login instead of /dashboard.
- Navigation and login redirect logic are now fully role-aware and minimal for admins, with no impact on non-admin workflows.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where admin users were incorrectly redirected to /dashboard after login, even when navigation was updated.
- Ensured all changes are fully documented and committed to a feature branch (not merged to main).

### Changed
- Header navigation links, user info, logout, and toggle buttons now use consistent color classes: light grey in light mode, white in dark mode, for a modern and accessible look.
- Navigation links font weight standardized to medium (500) for visual consistency.
- Toggle buttons (language/theme) now accept a className prop and inherit color from the header, ensuring correct color regardless of rebuilds or merges.
- All header hover states now use the brand red for both nav links and toggles.
- Admin panel: 'Ingresos Totales' (Total Revenue) now displays in green and uses the correct currency and locale based on the selected language (MXN for Spanish, USD for English), with robust formatting and forced color using Tailwind's important modifier.

### Fixed
- Resolved issues where header/toggle colors would revert after rebuilds or merges.
- Fixed admin revenue formatting and color to always match the selected language and design spec.

  - Improved frontend logout to clear cookies with all domain variations (development vs production)
  - Added comprehensive localStorage/sessionStorage cleanup
  - Added fallback error handling and forced cleanup mechanisms
  - Fixed issues where partial logout states could occur during network failures

### Changed
- **Demo User Navigation**: For demo users only, reordered navigation to show "Juegos" (Games) first, followed by "Panel"
  - Navigation now displays: "Juegos | Panel | Mi Historial | Perfil" for demo users
  - Panel link shows as "Panel" instead of "Admin Panel" for demo users
  - Regular admin users maintain original navigation order
  - No impact on regular user navigation

### Deployment
- **Environment Files**: Updated deployment script (`deploy.sh`) to use production environment files
  - Now uses `frontend/.env.production` and `backend/.env.production` for live deployments
  - Local development environment files remain unchanged
  - Ensures proper separation of development and production configurations
- **Build Process**: Fixed deployment script TypeScript compilation issues
  - Changed backend dependency installation to include dev dependencies for TypeScript build
  - Resolves missing @types/* packages needed for compilation
  - Production server still only uses compiled JavaScript files

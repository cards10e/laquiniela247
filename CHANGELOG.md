- **Backend:**
  - `/api/weeks/current` and `/api/games/current-week` endpoints now select the current week based on `status: 'OPEN'` and a future `bettingDeadline`, ordered by `startDate` and `weekNumber` (Prisma array syntax).

- Confirmed cookies were set and sent by browser but not used by backend.
- Identified duplicate/inconsistent API calls in frontend.
- Systematically tested and documented all steps before applying the fix.

### Changed
- Admin navigation for users with the admin role is now minimal: "Dashboard" and "My History" links are hidden, and "Admin Panel" is the default/leftmost view.
- Admin users are now redirected to /admin after login instead of /dashboard.

- Admin panel: 'Ingresos Totales' (Total Revenue) now displays in green and uses the correct currency and locale based on the selected language (MXN for Spanish, USD for English), with robust formatting and forced color using Tailwind's important modifier.

### Fixed
- Resolved issues where header/toggle colors would revert after rebuilds or merges.
- Fixed admin revenue formatting and color to always match the selected language and design spec.

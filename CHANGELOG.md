### 🎯 Betting Interface Fix: Complete Current Week Bet Visibility Restored
- **FIXED: Demo User Game Filtering - Missing Existing Bets Display (Issue #13)**: Resolved critical user experience issue where existing bets were not visible
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend filtering logic bug in `frontend/src/pages/bet.tsx` where `effectiveGamesWithBets` was hardcoded to empty array when `showCurrentWeekOnly = true`
  - **Impact**: Users could only see games available for new bets, but couldn't review their existing current week bets
  - **Solution**: Removed conditional filtering that hid existing bets, restoring complete betting interface visibility
  - **User Experience**: Both "Active Bets Placed" and "Games Available to Bet" sections now display properly

### 🔧 Frontend Logic Optimization
- **Enhanced Betting Interface Consistency**:
  ```typescript
  // BEFORE (BROKEN)
  const effectiveGamesWithBets = showCurrentWeekOnly ? [] : gamesWithBets;
  const effectiveHasAnyBets = showCurrentWeekOnly ? false : hasAnyBets;
  
  // AFTER (FIXED)
  const effectiveGamesWithBets = gamesWithBets;
  const effectiveHasAnyBets = hasAnyBets;
  ```

- **Restored Complete Betting View**:
  - **Single Bets Tab**: Now shows existing single bets + available games for single betting
  - **La Quiniela Tab**: Now shows existing parlay bets + available games for parlay betting
  - **Production Parity**: Local development and production environments now behave identically

  const filteredGames = useMemo(() => 
    isAdmin ? games : getAllRelevantGames(games), 
    [games, isAdmin]
  );
  
  // Memoized expensive calculations
  const gamesSections = useMemo(() => /* complex calculations */, [filteredGames]);
  const getGameDateRange = useMemo(() => /* date processing */, [filteredGames]);
  ```

- **Callback Optimization for Performance**:
  ```typescript
  const fetchBettingData = useCallback(async (): Promise<void> => {
    // Proper loading state management
    if (isLoadingRef.current) return;
    isLoadingRef.current = true;
    setLoading(true);
    // Enhanced AbortController implementation
  }, [tab]);
  
  const handlePredictionChange = useCallback((gameId: number, prediction: PredictionType): void => {
    setPredictions(prev => ({ ...prev, [gameId]: prediction }));
  }, []);
  ```

### 🔧 TypeScript Build System Enhancement
- **FIXED: Function Reference Errors**: Resolved critical useEffect execution failures
  - **Issue**: `fetchAdminGamesData` and `fetchBettingData` were referenced before definition
  - **Solution**: Moved function definitions before useEffect hooks that reference them

- **ENHANCED: Type Safety Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Fixed improper type casting
  status: (gamesData.week.status as Week['status']) || 'closed'
  
  // Added proper error type guards
  if (error instanceof Error && error.name === 'AbortError') {
    return; // Expected behavior, don't log as error
  }
  ```

### 🐛 Critical Error Handling & Stability Improvements
- **AbortController Management Enhancement**:
  ```typescript
  // Proper request cancellation and cleanup
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      if (abortControllerRef.current) {
        abortControllerRef.current.abort();
      }
    };
  }, []);
  ```

- **Loading State Race Condition Prevention**:
  ```typescript
  // Enhanced loading protection

  - **Before**: `UNIQUE KEY (user_id, game_id)` - prevented mixed bet types
  - **After**: `UNIQUE KEY (user_id, game_id, bet_type)` - allows single + parlay on same game
  - **Smart Prevention**: Still prevents duplicate bets of same type on same game
  - **Production Migration**: Applied direct database migration with zero downtime

### 🎯 Backend API Improvements
- **Fixed Prisma Query Logic**: Updated backend to use correct constraint reference
  - **Before**: `userId_gameId: { userId, gameId }` - caused validation errors

  - **Consistent State**: Betting interface now accurately reflects actual database state
  - **Proper Validation**: Duplicate prevention works correctly for each bet type independently

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Migration**:
  ```sql
  -- Removed problematic constraint
  ALTER TABLE bets DROP INDEX bets_user_id_game_id_key;
  
  -- Added enhanced constraint supporting bet types
  ALTER TABLE bets ADD UNIQUE KEY bets_user_id_game_id_bet_type_key (user_id, game_id, bet_type);
  ```
- **Prisma Schema Update**: `@@unique([userId, gameId, betType])` - enhanced constraint modeling

### 🚨 Critical Production Issue Fix - Rate Limiting
- **Fixed "Too Many Requests" API Rate Limiting**: Resolved critical production issue causing external API rate limit violations
  - **Problem**: Every user visiting the site started a 5-minute background timer making API calls to `exchangerate-api.com` and `fixer.io`
  - **Root Cause**: `exchangeRateService.startBackgroundRefresh()` created multiple intervals across browser tabs causing hundreds of API calls
  - **Impact**: External APIs rate-limited our production site, affecting all users with "too many requests" errors
  - **Solution**: Disabled aggressive background refresh while preserving intelligent on-demand currency conversion

### 🔧 Optimized Currency Exchange Architecture
- **Smart Caching Strategy**: Leveraged existing multi-layer cache system without background polling
  - **Fresh Cache**: 5 minutes for immediate accuracy
  - **Stale Tolerance**: 30 minutes for resilience during API downtime
  - **Fallback Rates**: Always-available backup rates prevent complete failure
  - **On-Demand Fetching**: Currency conversion only triggers API calls when users actually convert currencies
- **Multi-Provider Failover**: ExchangeRate-API and Fixer.io with graceful degradation maintained

### 🛡️ Production Rate Limiting Confirmation
- **Deploy Script Verification**: Confirmed `deploy.sh` automatically enables production rate limiting
  - **Development**: Rate limiting commented out for easy testing
  - **Production**: Deployment script uncomments all rate limiting middleware
  - **Default Limits**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP (very reasonable)
  - **Automatic**: No manual intervention required during deployment process

### 💡 Performance & Cost Optimization
- **Reduced External API Calls**: Eliminated unnecessary background API polling, reducing costs and improving reliability
- **Better User Experience**: Currency conversion still works seamlessly but only fetches rates when needed
- **Server Load Reduction**: Fewer background processes and API calls improve overall application performance
- **Sustainable Architecture**: Application now scales without hitting external API rate limits

### Fixed
- Production "too many requests" errors from external currency exchange APIs
- Multiple background refresh timers created by simultaneous user visits
- Excessive API calls to exchangerate-api.com and fixer.io services
- Potential cost escalation from unlimited background API polling

### Changed
- Disabled background currency refresh to prevent API rate limiting
- Currency exchange now operates on intelligent on-demand fetching
- Preserved all currency conversion functionality with better resource management
- Maintained multi-provider failover and caching strategies

### Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/context/CurrencyContext.tsx` - commented out `exchangeRateService.startBackgroundRefresh()`
- **Architecture Preserved**: All existing currency conversion, caching, and fallback logic intact
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Users experience identical currency functionality with better performance
- **Production Safety**: Deploy script continues to enable rate limiting as designed

## [2.0.21] - 2025-01-16
### 🔧 Critical Betting Countdown Fix
- **Fixed Incorrect Betting Deadline Display**: Enhanced primary week selection logic in `/api/games/current-week`
  - **Problem**: API was selecting highest numbered week (Week 99) with expired deadline, causing 11+ day countdown instead of correct 4-day countdown
  - **Root Cause**: Primary week selection used `openWeeks[0]` which picked highest `weekNumber` regardless of deadline validity
  - **Solution**: Implemented smart week selection algorithm that handles all scenarios:
    - **Multiple Valid Weeks**: Selects week with earliest (most urgent) deadline
    - **All Expired Weeks**: Falls back to most recently opened week (highest number)
    - **Single Valid Week**: Correctly selects that week
  - **Result**: Countdown now correctly shows ~4 days for games starting June 20th vs showing Week 26/11+ days
  
### 📅 Universal Betting Logic
- **Smart Week Prioritization**: Algorithm works for any number of open weeks with any deadline combinations
- **Deadline Urgency**: When multiple valid weeks exist, prioritizes the most urgent deadline
- **Graceful Fallback**: Handles edge cases where all deadlines have passed
- **User Experience**: Betting countdown timers now accurately reflect time remaining for actual betting window

### 🔐 Navigation Security & UX Enhancement
- **Fixed Demo User Admin Access Confusion**: Removed inappropriate admin panel link from demo user navigation
  - **Problem**: Demo users saw a "Panel" link in their navigation that led to admin functionality they couldn't access
  - **Root Cause**: Navigation logic incorrectly granted demo users a link to `/admin` despite having `USER` role, not `ADMIN`
  - **Security Impact**: No actual security breach - backend properly protected admin endpoints with role validation
  - **UX Impact**: Demo users experienced confusing navigation that redirected them away from intended functionality
  - **Solution**: Removed admin panel link entirely from demo user navigation menu

### 🎯 Role-Based Navigation Clarity
- **Clean Role Separation**: Navigation now properly reflects user permissions without misleading options
  - **Demo Users**: See only appropriate user-level navigation (Games, Dashboard, History, Profile)
  - **Regular Users**: Unchanged navigation experience with standard user options
  - **Admin Users**: Unchanged - retain full admin panel access as intended
  - **Eliminated Confusion**: No more "dead-end" links that redirect users away from their intended destination

- **Added**: `{ key: 'dashboard', href: '/dashboard', label: t('navigation.dashboard') }` for proper demo user flow
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved, only UI cleanup performed

## [2.0.17] - 2025-01-14
### 🎯 Dashboard Game Visibility Enhancement
- **Fixed Limited Game Display**: Resolved critical issue where dashboard only showed 1 upcoming game despite multiple scheduled games
  - **Problem**: Dashboard API call limited to 20 games with chronological ordering (oldest first) showing mostly completed games
  - **Root Cause**: `/api/games` endpoint returned first 20 games chronologically, which were primarily historical completed games

- Confirmed cookies were set and sent by browser but not used by backend.
- Identified duplicate/inconsistent API calls in frontend.
- Systematically tested and documented all steps before applying the fix.

### Changed
- Admin navigation for users with the admin role is now minimal: "Dashboard" and "My History" links are hidden, and "Admin Panel" is the default/leftmost view.
- Admin users are now redirected to /admin after login instead of /dashboard.
- Navigation and login redirect logic are now fully role-aware and minimal for admins, with no impact on non-admin workflows.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where admin users were incorrectly redirected to /dashboard after login, even when navigation was updated.
- Ensured all changes are fully documented and committed to a feature branch (not merged to main).

### Changed
- Header navigation links, user info, logout, and toggle buttons now use consistent color classes: light grey in light mode, white in dark mode, for a modern and accessible look.
- Navigation links font weight standardized to medium (500) for visual consistency.
- Toggle buttons (language/theme) now accept a className prop and inherit color from the header, ensuring correct color regardless of rebuilds or merges.
- All header hover states now use the brand red for both nav links and toggles.
- Admin panel: 'Ingresos Totales' (Total Revenue) now displays in green and uses the correct currency and locale based on the selected language (MXN for Spanish, USD for English), with robust formatting and forced color using Tailwind's important modifier.

### Fixed
- Resolved issues where header/toggle colors would revert after rebuilds or merges.
- Fixed admin revenue formatting and color to always match the selected language and design spec.

## [Unreleased] - June 2025

### Fixed
- **Critical Logout Bug**: Resolved high-priority logout issues when switching between users or ending testing sessions
  - Enhanced backend `/auth/logout` endpoint to properly clear HTTP-only cookies with correct domain/path settings
  - Improved frontend logout to clear cookies with all domain variations (development vs production)
  - Added comprehensive localStorage/sessionStorage cleanup
  - Added fallback error handling and forced cleanup mechanisms
  - Fixed issues where partial logout states could occur during network failures

### Changed
- **Demo User Navigation**: For demo users only, reordered navigation to show "Juegos" (Games) first, followed by "Panel"
  - Navigation now displays: "Juegos | Panel | Mi Historial | Perfil" for demo users
  - Panel link shows as "Panel" instead of "Admin Panel" for demo users
  - Regular admin users maintain original navigation order
  - No impact on regular user navigation

### Deployment
- **Environment Files**: Updated deployment script (`deploy.sh`) to use production environment files
  - Now uses `frontend/.env.production` and `backend/.env.production` for live deployments
  - Local development environment files remain unchanged
  - Ensures proper separation of development and production configurations
- **Build Process**: Fixed deployment script TypeScript compilation issues
  - Changed backend dependency installation to include dev dependencies for TypeScript build
  - Resolves missing @types/* packages needed for compilation
  - Production server still only uses compiled JavaScript files

- Admin: Restrict minute selection for game creation to :00, :15, :30, :45 and use dropdowns for hour/minute.
- Admin: Group existing games by week in the games list.
- Admin: Show a localized message when no games are scheduled (translation key added to I18nContext.tsx).
- Translation: Fixed translation loading to use I18nContext.tsx, not JSON files.

## [2.0.14] - 2025-06-13
### 🎯 Dashboard Status Enhancement & Admin Interface Simplification
- **Dashboard Status Badges**: Added live game status indicators to dashboard game cards
  - **Clean Status Display**: Shows "Live", "Completed", and "Scheduled" badges on dashboard game previews
  - **Consistent Styling**: Uses identical color scheme as admin panel (orange for Live, green for Completed, gray for Scheduled)
  - **Minimal Implementation**: 5-minute change leveraging existing status data and CSS components
  - **Enhanced UX**: Users can instantly see game status without navigating to betting page

### 🧹 Admin Interface Simplification (Microsoft DE Principles)
- **Removed Manual Override Buttons**: Eliminated redundant individual game status override controls
  - **Simplified Decision Making**: Removed cognitive overhead of choosing between manual override vs bulk sync
  - **Single Source of Truth**: "Game Status Sync" button now handles all status updates efficiently
  - **Cleaner Interface**: Removed 50+ lines of redundant UI code and logic
  - **Better Maintainability**: Consolidated status management into single, reliable system

### 🔧 Build System Enhancement
- **Fixed TypeScript Path Aliases**: Resolved module resolution issues preventing application startup
  - **Root Cause**: TypeScript compiler wasn't resolving `@/routes/auth` imports in compiled JavaScript
  - **Solution**: Added `tsc-alias` package to transform path aliases after compilation
  - **Build Process**: Updated to `tsc && tsc-alias` for proper module resolution
  - **Deployment Ready**: Application now starts successfully with resolved import paths

### 🎨 Status Display Consistency
- **Unified Status Logic**: Fixed priority ordering in admin panel status display
  - **Match Status Priority**: Live/Completed games now correctly override betting status
  - **Consistent Lowercase**: Normalized all status values to lowercase for reliability
  - **Real-Time Updates**: Added 30-second periodic refresh for live status changes
  - **Cache Busting**: Added timestamp parameters to ensure fresh status data

### Technical Improvements
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Eliminated duplicate status management patterns
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Single status update mechanism reduces inconsistency risk
- **Better Performance**: Removed redundant API calls and UI components
- **Improved Maintainability**: Centralized status logic easier to debug and enhance

### Added
- Status badges on dashboard game cards with text labels
- `tsc-alias` package for TypeScript path resolution
- Cache-busting parameters for admin data fetching
- Periodic refresh mechanism for live status updates

### Changed
- Admin panel status priority logic (match status over betting status)
- Build process to include path alias transformation
- Status normalization to consistent lowercase format
- Dashboard game cards to include status indicators

### Fixed
- TypeScript path alias resolution in compiled JavaScript
- Admin panel showing incorrect status priority
- Module resolution errors preventing application startup
- Status inconsistency between different interfaces

### Removed
- Manual override buttons from admin panel (both desktop and mobile)
- `handleUpdateGameStatus` function (no longer needed)
- Redundant status management UI components
- Complex decision-making between override methods

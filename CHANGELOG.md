## [2.0.26] - 2025-01-18
### üêõ Critical Bug Fix: Single Bets Not Persisting (Bug #11)
- **Fixed Database Constraint Issue**: Resolved critical bug where single bets appeared to be placed successfully but disappeared after user logout/login
  - **Root Cause**: Database unique constraint `UNIQUE(user_id, game_id)` prevented placing both single AND parlay bets on the same game by the same user
  - **Silent Failure Pattern**: API returned 200 OK but database silently rejected transactions due to constraint violations
  - **Prisma Client Mismatch**: Backend code using outdated constraint names after schema changes

### üîß Database Schema Migration
- **Enhanced Unique Constraint**: Updated database constraint to allow both bet types on same game
  - **Before**: `UNIQUE KEY (user_id, game_id)` - prevented mixed bet types
  - **After**: `UNIQUE KEY (user_id, game_id, bet_type)` - allows single + parlay on same game
  - **Smart Prevention**: Still prevents duplicate bets of same type on same game
  - **Production Migration**: Applied direct database migration with zero downtime

### üéØ Backend API Improvements
- **Fixed Prisma Query Logic**: Updated backend to use correct constraint reference
  - **Before**: `userId_gameId: { userId, gameId }` - caused validation errors
  - **After**: `userId_gameId_betType: { userId, gameId, betType: 'SINGLE' }` - proper type-aware validation
  - **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error logging for database constraint violations
  - **Type Safety**: Ensured TypeScript compatibility with new constraint structure

### üöÄ User Experience Restoration
- **Persistent Single Bets**: Single bets now correctly persist across login sessions
  - **Mixed Betting Support**: Users can place both single bets AND parlay bets on same games
  - **Eliminated "Endless Betting"**: Fixed confusing behavior where users could repeatedly place the same bet
  - **Consistent State**: Betting interface now accurately reflects actual database state
  - **Proper Validation**: Duplicate prevention works correctly for each bet type independently

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Migration**:
  ```sql
  -- Removed problematic constraint
  ALTER TABLE bets DROP INDEX bets_user_id_game_id_key;
  
  -- Added enhanced constraint supporting bet types
  ALTER TABLE bets ADD UNIQUE KEY bets_user_id_game_id_bet_type_key (user_id, game_id, bet_type);
  ```
- **Prisma Schema Update**: `@@unique([userId, gameId, betType])` - enhanced constraint modeling
- **Backend Logic Fix**: Updated bet validation to use type-aware constraint checking
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved with enhanced capabilities

### Fixed
- Single bets disappearing after user logout/login cycles

## [2.0.22] - 2025-01-16
### üö® Critical Production Issue Fix - Rate Limiting
- **Fixed "Too Many Requests" API Rate Limiting**: Resolved critical production issue causing external API rate limit violations
  - **Problem**: Every user visiting the site started a 5-minute background timer making API calls to `exchangerate-api.com` and `fixer.io`
  - **Root Cause**: `exchangeRateService.startBackgroundRefresh()` created multiple intervals across browser tabs causing hundreds of API calls
  - **Impact**: External APIs rate-limited our production site, affecting all users with "too many requests" errors
  - **Solution**: Disabled aggressive background refresh while preserving intelligent on-demand currency conversion

### üîß Optimized Currency Exchange Architecture
- **Smart Caching Strategy**: Leveraged existing multi-layer cache system without background polling
  - **Fresh Cache**: 5 minutes for immediate accuracy
  - **Stale Tolerance**: 30 minutes for resilience during API downtime
  - **Fallback Rates**: Always-available backup rates prevent complete failure
  - **On-Demand Fetching**: Currency conversion only triggers API calls when users actually convert currencies
- **Multi-Provider Failover**: ExchangeRate-API and Fixer.io with graceful degradation maintained

### üõ°Ô∏è Production Rate Limiting Confirmation
- **Deploy Script Verification**: Confirmed `deploy.sh` automatically enables production rate limiting
  - **Development**: Rate limiting commented out for easy testing
  - **Production**: Deployment script uncomments all rate limiting middleware
  - **Default Limits**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP (very reasonable)
  - **Automatic**: No manual intervention required during deployment process

### üí° Performance & Cost Optimization
- **Reduced External API Calls**: Eliminated unnecessary background API polling, reducing costs and improving reliability
- **Better User Experience**: Currency conversion still works seamlessly but only fetches rates when needed
- **Server Load Reduction**: Fewer background processes and API calls improve overall application performance
- **Sustainable Architecture**: Application now scales without hitting external API rate limits

### Fixed
- Production "too many requests" errors from external currency exchange APIs
- Multiple background refresh timers created by simultaneous user visits
- Excessive API calls to exchangerate-api.com and fixer.io services
- Potential cost escalation from unlimited background API polling

### Changed
- Disabled background currency refresh to prevent API rate limiting
- Currency exchange now operates on intelligent on-demand fetching
- Preserved all currency conversion functionality with better resource management
- Maintained multi-provider failover and caching strategies

### Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/context/CurrencyContext.tsx` - commented out `exchangeRateService.startBackgroundRefresh()`
- **Architecture Preserved**: All existing currency conversion, caching, and fallback logic intact
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Users experience identical currency functionality with better performance
- **Production Safety**: Deploy script continues to enable rate limiting as designed

## [2.0.21] - 2025-01-16
### üîß Critical Betting Countdown Fix
- **Fixed Incorrect Betting Deadline Display**: Enhanced primary week selection logic in `/api/games/current-week`
  - **Problem**: API was selecting highest numbered week (Week 99) with expired deadline, causing 11+ day countdown instead of correct 4-day countdown
  - **Root Cause**: Primary week selection used `openWeeks[0]` which picked highest `weekNumber` regardless of deadline validity
  - **Solution**: Implemented smart week selection algorithm that handles all scenarios:
    - **Multiple Valid Weeks**: Selects week with earliest (most urgent) deadline
    - **All Expired Weeks**: Falls back to most recently opened week (highest number)
    - **Single Valid Week**: Correctly selects that week
  - **Result**: Countdown now correctly shows ~4 days for games starting June 20th vs showing Week 26/11+ days
  
### üìÖ Universal Betting Logic
- **Smart Week Prioritization**: Algorithm works for any number of open weeks with any deadline combinations
- **Deadline Urgency**: When multiple valid weeks exist, prioritizes the most urgent deadline
- **Graceful Fallback**: Handles edge cases where all deadlines have passed
- **User Experience**: Betting countdown timers now accurately reflect time remaining for actual betting window

## [2.0.20] - 2025-01-16
### üé® Dashboard Visual Enhancement

  - **Green for Positive**: Total winnings values > $0 now display in green (`!text-success-600 dark:!text-success-400`)
  - **Red for Negative/Zero**: Total winnings values ‚â§ $0 now display in red (`!text-error-600 dark:!text-error-400`)
  - **Color Consistency**: Uses the exact same color scheme as the Total Revenue in the admin panel
  - **Visual Clarity**: Provides immediate visual feedback on user performance and profit/loss status
  - **Accessibility**: Maintains proper contrast ratios in both light and dark modes

### üí° UX Improvements
- **Performance Indicators**: Dashboard now provides clear visual cues for financial performance
- **Color Psychology**: Green indicates success/profit, red indicates loss/break-even
- **Admin Panel Consistency**: Maintains consistent color scheme across admin and user dashboards

## [2.0.19] - 2025-01-16
### üì± Mobile Admin Interface Enhancement
- **Fixed Duplicate Status Display**: Removed redundant "Closed" status indicators in mobile admin interface
  - **Problem**: Mobile admin view showed "Cerrada" (Closed) status twice for each betting week - once under the week title and again in the controls section
  - **User Impact**: Confusing and cluttered mobile interface with duplicate information
  - **Solution**: Removed secondary status display from Enhanced Week Controls while preserving primary status under week title
  - **Result**: Clean, streamlined mobile admin experience with single, clear status indication per week

### üéØ Mobile UX Improvements
- **Reduced Visual Clutter**: Mobile admin interface now shows essential information without redundancy
- **Maintained Functionality**: All admin capabilities preserved - only removed duplicate visual elements
- **Better Information Hierarchy**: Primary status indicators remain in logical position under week titles
- **Touch-Friendly Design**: Cleaner interface reduces cognitive load for mobile admin users

### Fixed

- **Preserved**: Primary status indicators under week titles and all functional controls
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All admin functionality remains intact, only UI cleanup performed

## [2.0.18] - 2025-01-16
### üîê Navigation Security & UX Enhancement
- **Fixed Demo User Admin Access Confusion**: Removed inappropriate admin panel link from demo user navigation
  - **Problem**: Demo users saw a "Panel" link in their navigation that led to admin functionality they couldn't access
  - **Root Cause**: Navigation logic incorrectly granted demo users a link to `/admin` despite having `USER` role, not `ADMIN`
  - **Security Impact**: No actual security breach - backend properly protected admin endpoints with role validation
  - **UX Impact**: Demo users experienced confusing navigation that redirected them away from intended functionality
  - **Solution**: Removed admin panel link entirely from demo user navigation menu

### üéØ Role-Based Navigation Clarity
- **Clean Role Separation**: Navigation now properly reflects user permissions without misleading options
  - **Demo Users**: See only appropriate user-level navigation (Games, Dashboard, History, Profile)
  - **Regular Users**: Unchanged navigation experience with standard user options
  - **Admin Users**: Unchanged - retain full admin panel access as intended
  - **Eliminated Confusion**: No more "dead-end" links that redirect users away from their intended destination

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Validation Confirmed
- **Backend Protection Intact**: All admin endpoints properly protected with `adminMiddleware` requiring `ADMIN` role
- **Frontend Route Protection**: `ProtectedRoute` component correctly blocks non-admin access to admin pages
- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT validation and role checking function as designed
- **No Functional Vulnerabilities**: Demo users never had actual admin access, only confusing UI elements

### Fixed
- Demo users seeing inappropriate "Panel" link in navigation menu
- Confusing UX where demo users clicked admin links only to be redirected
- Navigation inconsistency between user roles and available functionality

### Changed
- Demo user navigation no longer includes any admin-related links
- Simplified navigation logic for better role-based access control
- Enhanced user experience by removing misleading interface elements

### Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- **Logic Change**: Removed `{ key: 'admin', href: '/admin', label: 'Panel' }` from demo user navigation array
- **Added**: `{ key: 'dashboard', href: '/dashboard', label: t('navigation.dashboard') }` for proper demo user flow
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved, only UI cleanup performed

## [2.0.17] - 2025-01-14
### üéØ Dashboard Game Visibility Enhancement
- **Fixed Limited Game Display**: Resolved critical issue where dashboard only showed 1 upcoming game despite multiple scheduled games
  - **Problem**: Dashboard API call limited to 20 games with chronological ordering (oldest first) showing mostly completed games
  - **Root Cause**: `/api/games` endpoint returned first 20 games chronologically, which were primarily historical completed games
  - **Impact**: Users saw minimal upcoming betting opportunities on dashboard despite admin creating many scheduled games
  - **Solution**: Increased API limit to 100 games and implemented intelligent client-side sorting

### üß† Smart Game Prioritization
- **Intelligent Sorting Algorithm**: Dashboard now prioritizes upcoming games over completed games
  - **Upcoming Games First**: Scheduled games appear at top, sorted by date (earliest first)
  - **Recent Games Second**: Completed games follow, sorted by date (most recent first)
  - **Better User Experience**: Users see relevant betting opportunities prominently displayed
  - **Maintains UI Logic**: Still displays first 6 games but from a much better sorted collection

### üîß Technical Improvements

- Systematically tested and documented all steps before applying the fix.

### Changed
- Admin navigation for users with the admin role is now minimal: "Dashboard" and "My History" links are hidden, and "Admin Panel" is the default/leftmost view.
- Admin users are now redirected to /admin after login instead of /dashboard.
- Navigation and login redirect logic are now fully role-aware and minimal for admins, with no impact on non-admin workflows.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where admin users were incorrectly redirected to /dashboard after login, even when navigation was updated.
- Ensured all changes are fully documented and committed to a feature branch (not merged to main).

### Changed
- Header navigation links, user info, logout, and toggle buttons now use consistent color classes: light grey in light mode, white in dark mode, for a modern and accessible look.
- Navigation links font weight standardized to medium (500) for visual consistency.
- Toggle buttons (language/theme) now accept a className prop and inherit color from the header, ensuring correct color regardless of rebuilds or merges.
- All header hover states now use the brand red for both nav links and toggles.
- Admin panel: 'Ingresos Totales' (Total Revenue) now displays in green and uses the correct currency and locale based on the selected language (MXN for Spanish, USD for English), with robust formatting and forced color using Tailwind's important modifier.

### Fixed
- Resolved issues where header/toggle colors would revert after rebuilds or merges.
- Fixed admin revenue formatting and color to always match the selected language and design spec.

## [Unreleased] - June 2025

### Fixed
- **Critical Logout Bug**: Resolved high-priority logout issues when switching between users or ending testing sessions
  - Enhanced backend `/auth/logout` endpoint to properly clear HTTP-only cookies with correct domain/path settings
  - Improved frontend logout to clear cookies with all domain variations (development vs production)
  - Added comprehensive localStorage/sessionStorage cleanup
  - Added fallback error handling and forced cleanup mechanisms
  - Fixed issues where partial logout states could occur during network failures

### Changed
- **Demo User Navigation**: For demo users only, reordered navigation to show "Juegos" (Games) first, followed by "Panel"
  - Navigation now displays: "Juegos | Panel | Mi Historial | Perfil" for demo users
  - Panel link shows as "Panel" instead of "Admin Panel" for demo users
  - Regular admin users maintain original navigation order
  - No impact on regular user navigation

### Deployment
- **Environment Files**: Updated deployment script (`deploy.sh`) to use production environment files
  - Now uses `frontend/.env.production` and `backend/.env.production` for live deployments
  - Local development environment files remain unchanged
  - Ensures proper separation of development and production configurations
- **Build Process**: Fixed deployment script TypeScript compilation issues
  - Changed backend dependency installation to include dev dependencies for TypeScript build
  - Resolves missing @types/* packages needed for compilation
  - Production server still only uses compiled JavaScript files

## [2.0.14] - 2025-06-13
### üéØ Dashboard Status Enhancement & Admin Interface Simplification
- **Dashboard Status Badges**: Added live game status indicators to dashboard game cards
  - **Clean Status Display**: Shows "Live", "Completed", and "Scheduled" badges on dashboard game previews
  - **Consistent Styling**: Uses identical color scheme as admin panel (orange for Live, green for Completed, gray for Scheduled)
  - **Minimal Implementation**: 5-minute change leveraging existing status data and CSS components
  - **Enhanced UX**: Users can instantly see game status without navigating to betting page

### üßπ Admin Interface Simplification (Microsoft DE Principles)
- **Removed Manual Override Buttons**: Eliminated redundant individual game status override controls
  - **Simplified Decision Making**: Removed cognitive overhead of choosing between manual override vs bulk sync
  - **Single Source of Truth**: "Game Status Sync" button now handles all status updates efficiently
  - **Cleaner Interface**: Removed 50+ lines of redundant UI code and logic
  - **Better Maintainability**: Consolidated status management into single, reliable system

### üîß Build System Enhancement
- **Fixed TypeScript Path Aliases**: Resolved module resolution issues preventing application startup
  - **Root Cause**: TypeScript compiler wasn't resolving `@/routes/auth` imports in compiled JavaScript
  - **Solution**: Added `tsc-alias` package to transform path aliases after compilation
  - **Build Process**: Updated to `tsc && tsc-alias` for proper module resolution
  - **Deployment Ready**: Application now starts successfully with resolved import paths

### üé® Status Display Consistency
- **Unified Status Logic**: Fixed priority ordering in admin panel status display
  - **Match Status Priority**: Live/Completed games now correctly override betting status
  - **Consistent Lowercase**: Normalized all status values to lowercase for reliability
  - **Real-Time Updates**: Added 30-second periodic refresh for live status changes
  - **Cache Busting**: Added timestamp parameters to ensure fresh status data

### Technical Improvements
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Eliminated duplicate status management patterns
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Single status update mechanism reduces inconsistency risk
- **Better Performance**: Removed redundant API calls and UI components
- **Improved Maintainability**: Centralized status logic easier to debug and enhance

### Added
- Status badges on dashboard game cards with text labels
- `tsc-alias` package for TypeScript path resolution
- Cache-busting parameters for admin data fetching
- Periodic refresh mechanism for live status updates

### Changed
- Admin panel status priority logic (match status over betting status)
- Build process to include path alias transformation
- Status normalization to consistent lowercase format
- Dashboard game cards to include status indicators

### Fixed
- TypeScript path alias resolution in compiled JavaScript
- Admin panel showing incorrect status priority
- Module resolution errors preventing application startup
- Status inconsistency between different interfaces

### Removed
- Manual override buttons from admin panel (both desktop and mobile)
- `handleUpdateGameStatus` function (no longer needed)
- Redundant status management UI components
- Complex decision-making between override methods

I can help you run a MySQL query using that connection string. However, I need to know what specific query you'd like me to execute.

Could you please tell me:
1. What SQL query would you like me to run?
2. Are you looking to:
   - View table structure (DESCRIBE/SHOW TABLES)?
   - Select data from specific tables?
   - Insert/update/delete data?
   - Run a specific custom query?

Once you provide the query, I can execute it using the MySQL command line client with your connection details.

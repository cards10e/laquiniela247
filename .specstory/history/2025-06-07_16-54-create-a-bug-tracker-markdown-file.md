I got in, quick results.

Toggling the light/dark mode seems off. It starts light, I push the button and it stays white, I push again it goes Dark. There seems to be three modes and there should be just two.
Demo started on player dashboard, it should start on Juegos screen. Juegos should be the far left option.
 Crash at statistics option -

You don't need a 'Quick Actions' section of the Dashboard. All have a menu up top.

Hi Jim

I’ve been troubleshooting the live deployment since 5:30am. ☹️ but we are up and running finally. I have not had a chance to do live testing so if you could please take a look that would be great. I’m leaving now for Deer Park and will take a look at this tomorrow. 

One thing: make sure to always logout when you are 1. Switching users 2. Done for the day/night testing. I think there is still a logout bug.

Lmk your thoughts and keep me posted on what bugs you find.

MJ

I'll help you create a bug tracker markdown file based on the email conversation. I'll create a structured bug report that captures all the issues mentioned.

Let me create a new file called `BUGS.md` in the project root.

I've created a comprehensive bug tracker in `BUGS.md` that organizes all the issues mentioned in the email conversation. The bug tracker is structured into several sections:

1. Critical Issues - For crashes and major functionality problems
2. UI/UX Issues - For interface and user experience concerns
3. Authentication Issues - For login/logout related problems

Each bug entry includes:
- Status
- Priority
- Reporter
- Date
- Description
- Additional notes or workarounds where applicable

I've also included the test credentials at the bottom for easy reference.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the format or add any additional information to the bug tracker?

_**User**_

hi can you please ￼search through the transcribed meeting (voice to text) and extract only the feature updates and issues for the laquinitela 247 web app and add each to the attached @BUGS.md file? You are an expert in transcription and UX/UI design: SPEAKER 1
OK, can you make your screen bigger?

￼  SPEAKER 1
And by the way, the that's much better.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So the users thing did crash on me.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It didn't crash before, but I think it was because I had a cache page, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
But it's a crash.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Yep, Yep, Yep.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I got that same exact error.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So OK, good.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, let's see.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So now admin, why is there a dashboard for admin?

￼  SPEAKER 1
I was going to ask you about that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's easy to remove.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I mean, I can take that out.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Yep.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And my history doesn't seem to make sense for admin either.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Take out, take out Dashboard, take out my history for admin.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I was thinking about that yesterday after I sent you the e-mail, but that's OK.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I mean, those are I think those are cosmetic things, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
Right.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I'm just OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Games seems useful because you want to see what the games look like, right?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Basically you're adding things profile.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Is there profile related to admin?

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's an admin needs to change your own password.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Definitely, definitely.

￼  SPEAKER 2
The profile makes sense.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I always start up.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I guess with the one on the left and then when we get to user for user games should be on the left.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So it it opens up in games, not dashboard.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, hold on just a second here.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Just taking short notes here.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, well, you got the recording.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I know sometimes it doesn't work.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Hang on.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So no dashboard, no games for I'm quick here.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So I'm not.

￼  SPEAKER 1
No problem.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Take your time.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Yes.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Sorry.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I didn't.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I didn't catch you earlier.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I wanted to talk to you guys, but it's like, God, I'm so tired right now.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So I mean like what's his overall feedback?

￼  SPEAKER 1
Like what did you I mean so he likes.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It big things the the when with the team names there should always be a logo, team logo.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so people you know they don't have to read much.

￼  SPEAKER 2
They can just look at stuff really quick and graphical and then.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And I'll go through some of the specific.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Stuff I because I wrote it down.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, great.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You're gonna send me your notes too, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
I wrote it on paper.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, no problem.

￼  SPEAKER 1
No problem.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You know what you could do?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Just take a picture of it and send me the picture too.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You can do that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, let let's talk through it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
My handwriting is horrible.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, all right.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I never remember your handwriting being horrible.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Well, when I write for me, it's horrible.

￼  SPEAKER 2
When I write for other people, I try to.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I take more time.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I know how that goes.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, keep going.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Sorry.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I don't mean to interrupt you.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so for admin panel, I mean overall he liked it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You know, he thinks we're pretty close.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It's just that the graphics and then the when we get to bets, he wants to be able to toggle between MXN, which is pesos, USD, which is dollars, which is crypto.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You know what?

￼  SPEAKER 1
You know what?

￼  SPEAKER 1
I was thinking about that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'm glad we had this feedback session before.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I made a lot of assumptions about some of that stuff and it's not hard to change.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's the cool thing about the architecture.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's not really hard to.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's not really hard to modify.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's just time consuming.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's not hard work, it's just a lot of work that makes sense.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I guess anyway, OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so overview look good.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Total users, active users, total that, total revenue.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And so there wasn't anything.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I'm not sure what user activity rate means, but he didn't have any.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I said, you know, give us ideas on what you want to see.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So he he didn't have anything immediately.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So OK, let's see.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So selecting weeks.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So I I noticed that you the games dates.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Are within that range, that week range, which is really nice.

￼  SPEAKER 2
He said that most of the games are on the hour, but so OK and actually let's see 1912.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, but so I see AM PM OK and then so there's an easier way to do that.

￼  SPEAKER 2
There's an easier way to.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Do that what you're doing there.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So go click out of that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Click out of that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Just hit escape.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I think you hit escape.

￼  SPEAKER 1
There you go.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Now go the date.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So go to game date.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Type zero or type.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You already have the day, so just to say pick a day.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So you got that week, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
16th and the 22, just do 21st, just under DD, under DD, click on it and then type 21.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Day, two one.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Yep.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Then you do the time 1212.

￼  SPEAKER 2
That's not easier.

￼  SPEAKER 1
No.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, all right.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It was easier for me, so.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But that's OK.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, good.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'm glad.

￼  SPEAKER 1
If you like that, then we do it that way.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But but for the list of minutes, just have default to 00 and then have 1530 and 45.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, that's should be pretty easy.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Yep, remove stuff.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So then and then so then that's really quick to right.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So it's really quick to select.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then logos here.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I mean, it's I don't know if we can.

￼  SPEAKER 2
That's less critical.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Logos need to happen on on the one where people see it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But you know what?

￼  SPEAKER 1
So the logo should be showing on the existing games on the bottom there that should be showing.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, yes, I need to, I need to fix that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, so that sounds good.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, it's a good way to do it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then let's see, pick these guys.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Create game and then it's is it added down below or is it working?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Could be, should be.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Those are all the ones I tested.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Update result doesn't work, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's just that's mock data.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So what I'm doing there is combining the mock data.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And when I say mock data, that is data that's hard coded on the page, not even in the database.

￼  SPEAKER 1
However, when you create a game, that's actually in the database.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It's actually being pushed into the database and I'm assuming in the future when you click on the different games, that update result will show.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Yes.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Or I mean, so you've got.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Scheduled, you've got delete, why don't you just add update result?

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then that's what pops it up, that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Makes the UI more consistent there, right?

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then this should be grouped by week.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Right.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You've got different weeks here.

￼  SPEAKER 2
These games should be, you know, week 21, the games week 21, week 22, games week 22.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, right.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then we'll just pull an individual week.

￼  SPEAKER 2
We'll pull a whole week for the games we show users.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But people might want to schedule, you know, several weeks in advance, OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And what did you have under users?

￼  SPEAKER 1
What was the admin doing for you?

￼  SPEAKER 1
So what that admin the the workflow there was admin can click on the users and that is a listing of all registered users from the database for MySQL and they can actually deactivate users if they want to.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So if you have somebody that would request their account to be the lead, that's where they would do it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
An admin would do it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, that sounds good.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then and it should show, let's see.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So there's we're allowing people to sign up with their profile.

￼  SPEAKER 2
To get paid, you need to basically be verified, maybe call it verified where you can provide your passport and maybe you know tax.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I have a whole workflow for that already designed.

￼  SPEAKER 1
There's gonna be we should have asked them this, this is my fault.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I think we kind of talked about it, a payments screen or a payments page.

￼  SPEAKER 2
On the top there, right.

￼  SPEAKER 2
We'll do that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I guess we'll do that when we do payments, but phase two, right.

￼  SPEAKER 1
But I mean, so my point was is you have your payments and then I think if I remember right under profile here, you'll have another item list there where it says payouts or winnings or whatever.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Then the person can withdraw their bank account.

￼  SPEAKER 1
for something for that effect or however you guys want it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I mean, I could do it all on the payments page.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That makes more sense.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I mean, maybe here, typically what happens from a UX perspective profile, you're going to have your billing details here.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So like which credit cards you have, if you have Bitcoins, if you're going to, you know, add a card or delete a card or modify a card.

￼  SPEAKER 1
But then your payments page will have the actual, OK, this is what you've won.

￼  SPEAKER 1
This is your earnings.

￼  SPEAKER 1
This is what you are going to get for a payout.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And then why wouldn't that be my history?

￼  SPEAKER 1
You could do that there if you wanted to.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's more.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I mean, I would would you.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So let me ask you a question.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So do you want that to be history integrated with payments or payments integrated with history?

￼  SPEAKER 1
And the only reason why I'm asking that is that it's going to change the title up top.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Well, let's worry about that when we do payments.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's a big design decision.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It won't be hard to add that in there.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And then this summary should be at the top.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Which summary?

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then and then the details can be below that, let's see.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So in the future for payments we'll need to have probably in the profile it'll have it'll probably there'll be one for payment information as you mentioned probably another tab for you know user verification or something or I don't know what we'll call it tax verification or something but that's we'll do when we do payments.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I think you said we need to verify age or have some sort of base.

￼  SPEAKER 2
There's a little bit of age, but we we need to verify there's individual who the individual is for anti money laundering laws and for paying taxes, reporting taxes.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Got it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So we will be pretty and that's why I didn't want to do payments because it's a it's a pretty.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Big deal.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's a big.

￼  SPEAKER 1
There's a lot verifying their and making sure they really.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Have real government documents.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So and not forgeries.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, let's see here.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so admin, I think that's it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Obviously get the users working, user screen working.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so for the individual, let's pretend like we're.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You got to log out.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You got to log out.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It's all the same stuff here.

￼  SPEAKER 2
We can just look at it, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
I think the some of the work flows are a little bit different because I don't think.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I don't know if that works for admin.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Does it work?

￼  SPEAKER 1
I don't know.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I didn't test it for admin because I wasn't even.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I wasn't even focused on it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It's working.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, so OK, so there's an issue there.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So single bets.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I took it out for the individual user.

￼  SPEAKER 1
For I did.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I took that out.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It's still in.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I see it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Well, what I did is I didn't.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I guess if let me say it a different way, I disabled it, you know, for a regular user.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So if he if.

￼  SPEAKER 2
He wants that, I mean.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's easy to add back in.

￼  SPEAKER 1
He does like it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
He does.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Cool.

￼  SPEAKER 1
See, I took a chance.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I was.

￼  SPEAKER 2
That's funny.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, OK, cool.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I like that idea.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I mean, I think people, you know, I like the idea of being able to do a single or parlay, but that's pretty common on.

￼  SPEAKER 1
But I mean, you know, to you, it's a Mexican market.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You guys know that market better than I do.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So you need logos, right?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Everywhere there's a name, there should be a logo.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Probably the name above and home below, right?

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then what?

￼  SPEAKER 2
So this big bedding window too big, make it the size of the the square and then put and then allow the ability to choose, you know, the MXNUSD or USDT for the currency, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, so the way that that works is we have a localization file.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I have two localization files, one for Spanish, the other one for English, and the way the I have a translation system.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So the way that works is whatever language it is, it'll show the currency.

￼  SPEAKER 1
But I mean, if we want to select it, make it selectable, then you know it's going to take a little bit more, a little bit more, not too much, but I mean.

￼  SPEAKER 1
By default, it should show up.

￼  SPEAKER 1
If you're in Spanish version, it'll show pesos.

￼  SPEAKER 2
If you're in English, it's going to show dollars.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I would do English.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But I live in Mexico.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, alright, I got you.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Yep.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So I mean for now you can just.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Do a pull down list box with three options.

￼  SPEAKER 2
That should be not hard.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It doesn't.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It's a demo.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then that would be so then that so you have the number to here which is still a big number, you have currency and then you can have your placement.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Over here.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So left hand side number middle currency and then place that I see.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And the currency is going to be next to the number not right in.

￼  SPEAKER 1
The middle probably.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Layout work there for that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And he did say.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So I asked him, he said.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So for La Quiniela, there's no bet amount.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It's it's fixed.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So if you just say here 200 pesos to win 2000.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Pesos, well, was that number always the same for every game?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Yes, every.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Wow.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Wow.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Cool.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, alright, that makes it easy.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's really easy though.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then I see you need the logos here.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And what else did you say?

￼  SPEAKER 2
And he does want to enforce only one bet per week.

￼  SPEAKER 1
One bet per week for parlay or single bets.

￼  SPEAKER 2
For the lakinella single bets.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, so one bet.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You meaning 11 bet for the whole parlay, right?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Got it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, got it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Cool.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I'm still questioning, but we'll see.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Did you ask him about that?

￼  SPEAKER 2
I mean, I did.

￼  SPEAKER 2
He was sure.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, alright.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then make sure that the user comes out on this games page first, right?

￼  SPEAKER 2
That it's a regular user.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so I'm just going through my notes.

￼  SPEAKER 2
We got that.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Keep individual games, Mexican bet, be able to switch between.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, told you that 200 for Mexican to win 2000.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Fixed them out and then one that.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so I covered all the things he talked about there.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, admin panel.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, we talked about making the minutes for 0153045 existing games group by schedule week.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, OK or OK, wait, I'll do the login later.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Panel.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so he agreed on the dashboard that the quick actions is confusing.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So take that one out.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So he doesn't want that.

￼  SPEAKER 2
No.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, because it's all up top.

￼  SPEAKER 1
All right, we'll take that out.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Current week and there's recent activity.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I like the recent.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Activity because it says view all history, but OK, do you?

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so at this point if we want to just take out quick actions, I think we're OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so current week open for betting.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So it would show.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so I see.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So it shows here the individual best, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
Yes.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK and then but you should have amounts.

￼  SPEAKER 2
For each bet too, right.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So America versus Chivas, you've got a date.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I think if I remember right, that's just my second preview of the teams.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I could.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I was actually thinking about taking that completely out, but.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Well, so somehow, I mean, so it's good for the current week to show what your betting is.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I don't think you need place bet here because that's the games.

￼  SPEAKER 2
This should just be what you've already bet.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I mean, maybe maybe you have a a link to take you to games?

￼  SPEAKER 1
I think that's what it does.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, great.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, perfect.

￼  SPEAKER 2
That's good.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So we'll do.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It's interesting that summary.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So OK, so this will be 200 to win 2000.

￼  SPEAKER 2
This will be single bets.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You can go to the dashboard and see what you've bet for this week.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I mean, do we want, why have recent activity here instead of having them just hit my history?

￼  SPEAKER 1
You know, it's kind of a good UX practice to make navigation easy.

￼  SPEAKER 1
If someone's on mobile, it's a little bit easier to just kind of click down.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Well, cause cause the current week it could get big.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So given that I could see value in the recent activity.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So we'll try it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And then make sure your history is easy to get to.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, let's see.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So in panel, yes, so that's moving.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, got that.

￼  SPEAKER 2
We talked about history where the summaries at the top.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So the same thing, the only other, OK.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Wanted to make sure the La Quinella logos are clear and struggling a little bit with that.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Well, I have a solution for that.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So there, I mean, that's.

￼  SPEAKER 1
The best you're going to get there, right when you're in dark mode.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Does you want to make them bigger?

￼  SPEAKER 1
Does he want to?

￼  SPEAKER 1
I have, I might have a solution.

￼  SPEAKER 1
What's that?

￼  SPEAKER 2
So what's your solution?

￼  SPEAKER 1
Well, there's a solution.

￼  SPEAKER 1
If I convert that image, I think it's a transparent image.

￼  SPEAKER 1
There's a way to force it when it's in light mode.

￼  SPEAKER 1
When the web page is in light mode, there's a there's an option to automatically flip, invert the colors of the font, not the Mexico, but it'll force it to black when it's in light mode.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So I'm going to test that and see if it works and I'll show it to you because then that requires no.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Changes to the actual logo, which I don't want to get in the business of, otherwise it takes too.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It takes too long to fix it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So OK, you see what I was saying before about.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So we have light mode, dark mode, that's system, that's system, that's system.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So that means some people like me who have a Mac, you don't have, you don't have this because you're on Windows or maybe you do my.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Background will change based on the time of day.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So it's light mode.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Auto means it's light.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Auto is light mode and when it turns a certain time of the evening, it'll go to dark mode and that's what that setting enforces.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So whatever that's good, that's a good UX design, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
Same type of thing.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And you got to remember we're doing this for mobile too.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So mobile will have that same.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So the last thing you want is.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It to be 10:00 at night.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Someone's looking at placing bets and then it's it comes up, you're in dark mode and then the page comes up as light mode.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's like extremely frustrating for me or users.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's not a good UX design practice.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, OK, OK, that's fine.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Sounds good.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, so but you could also in light mode put a background, a dark background behind it, the logo.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I was thinking about that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Maybe just keeping a black banner all the time for the whole thing, that whole top.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Now I was kind of.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Thinking about doing that.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And then here too, La Canela, we need.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So this logo should be bigger, should be more legible.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Yep, Yep.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It doesn't get lost with the white.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So let me work on that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Let me see what I can do there.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, and I'm assuming it's we don't want logos on the sides because then like on phones or narrower screen lost, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
No, you don't want to do that because when you go into, when you go into mobile, all of these logos, they automatically resize for mobile screens.

￼  SPEAKER 1
There's a format or a standard for mobile devices.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And even accessibility that I'm following for keyboard now, so say somebody's a blind user, you still have to make this accessible for them.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So we don't really want to change what we have here because this is following UX design best practices.

￼  SPEAKER 1
But I will tell you this, go back, can.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You log in real quick?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Yep, just a second, I'm trying on the phone.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Okay, so okay.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Now, one thing that's important to talk about when you're on a mobile device, you're not going to see, you're not going to see all of those app options.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's going to be what's called a hamburger menu.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's going to pop.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's like a a menu you click on a mobile device, you tap it and then it shows admin panel, games, my history profile.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's a design best practice on mobile devices.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Facebook has it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
All of the, you know, large, big mobile applications have that design.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It just makes the UX so much simpler for somebody on a mobile device.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So that's a little bit different.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I can show you that maybe Monday.

￼  SPEAKER 1
What it looks like?

￼  SPEAKER 1
I can show it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
To you in real time.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Password was used was found in a data breach.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's just a common password.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Admin 123 is not a very secure password.

￼  SPEAKER 1
In fact, I'm probably going to change that.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, the hamburger menu, you're talking about the three lines?

￼  SPEAKER 1
Yep, the three lines on the top right.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Remember, on a mobile device will show when you the user, they'll see the hamburger menu and when they're on mobile.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Then when they click on it, they'll get all of the navigation options.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And that is a best practice for UX.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Otherwise it looks terrible.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It looks terrible on mobile and you don't want to do that.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Your users are going to get pissed.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So I'm looking on the phone right now.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I really wanted to make sure.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That, you know, if I'm somebody like somebody that wants to use this app, you have to make it just as easy for them to buy and do things on mobile as they do on desktop.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Otherwise they don't want to use it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
They really don't want to use it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So cool.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, good to see.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, yes.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So then we talked about the logo and that was the last feedback we had talking.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's a lot.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's a lot of stuff.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I I will tell you right now with all this stuff, I'll be lucky to be.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'll be lucky to be done by next Friday because there's a lot.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It's just a lot of stuff.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I got to test it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I got to, you know, it's just help testing.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So what what is?

￼  SPEAKER 2
So what's a lot of work?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Which parts are a lot of work?

￼  SPEAKER 1
Well, I've got to incorporate a lot of code changes, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
And The thing is, and we know this just from our experience, we don't want to break existing code.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's my biggest thing.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So what I do to mitigate that is I check out, I have a main main branch where all the code is and then I do feature branch checkouts and in those feature branch checkouts, that's where I'm going to develop new features.

￼  SPEAKER 1
But sometimes the features break things.

￼  SPEAKER 1
In the core functionality, then I have to revert back to man.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So that's the first thing that I'm worried about.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And then the second, I mean that's just software development.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And then secondly, it's easy to develop and do unit testing on my local machine.

￼  SPEAKER 1
But when I deploy the live, that whole architecture is different.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'm on Mac OS, Mac OS uses the ARM.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'm using the ARM processor when I move to production prod.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'm on Ubuntu and that can cause some issues.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I know I I spent about a day and a half troubleshooting fraud issues just because the architecture differences and you know, I have to figure that shit out by myself.

￼  SPEAKER 1
But I mean, I'm using some things to help me out like a I that can ask a I or Google and I can look at stack overflow, but that stuff just takes time, right?

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, I mean, I just I wanted to try to keep things.

￼  SPEAKER 2
There's a lot, there's a lot.

￼  SPEAKER 1
There's a big list here.

￼  SPEAKER 1
There's a lot of stuff.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Some of it might take, some of it might not take a long time, but if it's breaking other parts of the core app, then that's when I have to do a lot of troubleshooting.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So, OK, well, take a look.

￼  SPEAKER 1
If I think that's a lot of.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Work, let me know because it you're trying to do like hiding stuff for.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I mean, we've got the logos to put in there.

￼  SPEAKER 2
That seemed to be the new functionality.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Other stuff could be done.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You know, we're still in demo mode.

￼  SPEAKER 1
We have the logos, so the logos, the logos are database.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So here's the other thing and just so you know, you'll understand this.

￼  SPEAKER 1
We have a pretty robust database schema in MySQL and the database we don't want to be making.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Database changes until we get to payments, because when we make database changes, that means I have to update the back end code, the middleware and the front end code.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And then that's just going to take a lot of work, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
So what I'm trying to do is keep the database schema intact and drive all of the changes through the middleware APIs there in the front end so that there's no.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So it's not as hard, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
If it's a front end issue, OK, it's just UX styling I can.

￼  SPEAKER 1
It won't be too difficult, but if we start thinking the database BMS, then that's when you know you could really easily break other parts of the app.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's just one thing.

￼  SPEAKER 1
And then the other thing could be API routes, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
When the front end makes calls, it's going to step the authentication and then it's going to send it to an API route, which in the middleware will route it to the right back end code.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That runs it because our architects are extensible.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I just want to make sure none of that shit breaks.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So I have a lot to think about.

￼  SPEAKER 1
No, I mean, I mean.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You know, Friday, worst case.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's what I'm saying.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Over under commit, over deliver, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
So if I can do it sooner, you you bet.

￼  SPEAKER 1
If something seems hard, I'll definitely let you know where I'm at.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Maybe you and I can brainsporm on some things.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, well let let me know Monday cause I I I had told Juan Carlos I thought it would be the first half of of this week so or the coming week.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So if it's if I need to say I was wrong I'll say it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But just I want you to take a look.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Let me take a look and then I'll let.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You know cause cause we want to get it.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You know it's you know originally we talked about one week.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I think we're at 2 weeks now so I didn't want to.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You know, I mean, three weeks is a lot more than, you know, a lot more than one week.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So remember Jeff Paul at Microsoft?

￼  SPEAKER 1
He taught me one valuable lesson.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Developing software is easy.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Shipping in is very hard.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That was something that I always remember.

￼  SPEAKER 1
There's always shit that comes up.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So anyway, no, we'll do our best.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But I mean, but Juan Carlos does want to make sure that it's stable.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I mean, so he he he that's it it it what what's working should work well and all the time.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Exactly because he's going to be demoing this.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Is he going to run the demo by the way or is or is I don't know either he or I.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I would actually prefer since you know so much about it, but you know, I guess a real test is it's.

￼  SPEAKER 1
He can run it successfully on his own and he can sell it.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That really shows that what we built, you know, it's really good, right?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Right.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But we, I mean, and we might fly to Amsterdam.

￼  SPEAKER 2
In person.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Wow.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Wow, that's cool.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's really cool.

￼  SPEAKER 2
It's a big deal to get it working.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Well, I don't think we're that far off though, right?

￼  SPEAKER 1
I mean, what we're, I don't see anything that's

￼  SPEAKER 1
My God, this is an earth shattering.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I think we're close.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I mean, you know, what would you say 8590% of the way, maybe no more.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'd say 90%.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Well, Carlos likes to say 80%, but obviously the last 1020% is usually.

￼  SPEAKER 1
As much time as the 1st 80%.

￼  SPEAKER 1
There you go, Jim.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You know, see, This is why I love working with you because you know, but I mean, you know me, I I work hard.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'll work.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I work nights and weekends when I have to to get shit done, so I will be working on this.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And you know, I mean, and it's a lot of work for 400 bucks, so that's why I didn't.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Work.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You know, you know, you know.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So I mean, if there's an opportunity, if he sells this and says, "Oh, Dimitri wants it and there's an opportunity to get more paid.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Work out of it, hell yes." So Juan Carlos is going to try to.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Right.

￼  SPEAKER 2
He he he thinks and I'll see if it happens.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But you know if Dimitri goes for it, he we're going to want you know Dimitri to pay for the development and then we would pay you for the development.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So and and I'm not planning and I'm assuming we are not going to take any money away from development as a you know we'll we'll make our money on the other stuff.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So you're going to make your money when you sell this when you sell this shit, right?

￼  SPEAKER 2
Exactly.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So.

￼  SPEAKER 1
You'll look at, you'll look at me, you'll look at the small amount you paid me a lot, right.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So I I mean.

￼  SPEAKER 2
And and I'm assuming that you know it's many 10s of thousands of dollars from Dimitri to finish all the.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Development and get it working.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Does he just want this in Mexico first?

￼  SPEAKER 2
We'll have to see.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I mean I think it's it's targeted the Mexico market, but you know they've got the ability to do U.S.

￼  SPEAKER 2
dollars and crypto.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So it could be.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Access anywhere.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Well, that's why.

￼  SPEAKER 1
So that was really important to me about the localization piece.

￼  SPEAKER 1
If we ever have to add additional languages, it's very easy to do.

￼  SPEAKER 1
They're just Jason files.

￼  SPEAKER 1
They're just Jason files.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Good, good, good.

￼  SPEAKER 2
I mean, I I think the languages are good.

￼  SPEAKER 2
You know, English, a lot of gamblers will speak English and maybe Russian, maybe Chinese.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's not an issue.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So, well, that's great.

￼  SPEAKER 2
But this lacanela is a specific, you know, interest in Mexico.

￼  SPEAKER 2
So you know, and I think you know other countries in South America where Spanish would be spoken, you know, maybe we'd want to do Portuguese for Brazil, not sure, but but that's great that it's flexible, that it's easier.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, well, I'm going to run here.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, I don't.

￼  SPEAKER 1
If you don't have anything else, I'm going to.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'm going to jam because I'm just sitting here.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Austin's on his phone.

￼  SPEAKER 1
OK, OK, great.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I'm finally starting to wake up.

￼  SPEAKER 1
Geez.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, I know it's bad.

￼  SPEAKER 1
I was so tired last night.

￼  SPEAKER 1
That's the weekend.

￼  SPEAKER 2
OK, cool.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Take care.

￼  SPEAKER 2
Thank you.

￼  SPEAKER 1
What are you?

￼  SPEAKER 1
What are you doing for the rest of the weekend?

￼  SPEAKER 1
Are you going to hang out with your girlfriend or?

￼  SPEAKER 2
So actually, I'm going to do a bit of work this weekend.

The bug tracker now reflects all the feedback from the meeting, including both immediate fixes needed and future improvements. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the organization or add any additional details to specific issues?

---

_**User**_

can you pls check the transcription one more time to ensure nothing is missed? also the @BUGS.md pls dont intermix features and bugs / make sure there are separate features/bugs for each -- dont aggregate any of the meeting details

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the transcription again and reorganize the BUGS.md file to clearly separate bugs from features. Let me create a new structure that distinguishes between these categories.

_**User**_

in our login workflow for the laquinela 247 demo, can you carefully analyze @logotipo-la-quiniela-247-min-2-1-1.png to see if it can be enlarged on the hero page by 10px? in light mode, can we try to invert the color scheme to black to see if it looks better?

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a careful analysis and recommendation for your login workflow regarding the provided logo:

### 1. Enlarging the Logo by 10px
- The image you provided is a PNG, not an SVG. PNGs can be resized, but enlarging by 10px (width or height) is generally safe and will not cause significant quality loss, especially for small increments.
- If the logo is currently, for example, 300px wide, you can set it to 310px wide in your hero section. This is a minor change and should not distort the image.

**Action:**  
You can safely increase the displayed size of this PNG logo by 10px in your hero section using CSS or inline styles.

### 2. Inverting the Color Scheme in Light Mode
- PNGs do not support direct color inversion like SVGs do. However, you can use CSS filters to invert the colors of a PNG.
- In light mode, applying `filter: invert(1);` to the image will invert all colors, turning white to black and vice versa. This will make the logo predominantly black, but it will also invert the green and red, which may not be desirable for branding.
- If you want only the white to become black and keep the green/red, you would need an SVG or a custom version of the logo.

**Action:**  
- You can try the following CSS for the logo in light mode:
  ```css
  .logo-invert-light {
    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
  }
  ```
  - This will invert the colors. The `hue-rotate` can help correct the color shift for green/red, but results may vary.
- For best results and brand consistency, consider requesting an SVG or a black version of the logo from your designer.

---

### Summary of Recommendations
- **Enlargement:** Yes, you can enlarge the PNG by 10px on the hero page.
- **Inversion:** You can invert the PNG in light mode using CSS, but the result may not be perfect for brand colors. For full control, use an SVG or a custom black version.

Would you like a code snippet for implementing these changes in your login page? If so, please specify if you’re using React, plain HTML/CSS, or another framework.

You are correct: the logo is only referenced in the header/nav (Header.tsx), login page (login.tsx), and register page (register.tsx). Here’s a careful plan for replacing the PNG logo with the SVG:

**What to do:**
- Replace all instances of `/logotipo-la-quiniela-247-min-2-1-1.png` with `/laquiniela247-svg.svg` in:
  - `frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/login.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/register.tsx`

**Notes:**
- The SVG will scale better and look sharper, especially when enlarged.
- You can now use CSS (including `filter: invert(1);` for light mode) for color adjustments if needed.
- No other codebase references to the PNG logo were found, so no changes are needed elsewhere.

**Next step:**  
Would you like the SVG to be slightly larger than the PNG in all locations, or only on the login hero section? And do you want the color inversion applied only in light mode, or always?

Once you confirm, I’ll proceed with the precise code changes!

---

_**User**_

only larger on the hero section on the login page, if you can make it slightly bigger on the header that would be great but dont go too big. And yes, i want to try the color inversion in light mode ONLY for the "La Quiniela 247" text and not any other text in the svg.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great, here’s the precise plan for your requirements:

**1. Replace PNG with SVG:**
- Update all references in `Header.tsx`, `login.tsx`, and `register.tsx` to use `/laquiniela247-svg.svg`.

**2. Sizing:**
- On the login page hero section: Make the SVG logo noticeably larger than before (e.g., increase height from 64px to 80px or as appropriate for your design).
- In the header/nav: Make the SVG logo slightly larger than before, but keep it compact (e.g., increase height from 32px to 40px).

**3. Color Inversion (Light Mode Only, “La Quiniela 247” text only):**
- This requires targeting the text element inside the SVG. If the SVG is structured with a `<text>` or a group for “La Quiniela 247”, you can use CSS to invert just that part in light mode.
- If the SVG is not structured this way, you may need to edit the SVG file to add a class or ID to the “La Quiniela 247” text for targeted styling.

**4. No changes to other text (e.g., “MÉXICO”) or the soccer ball/graphics.**

---

**Next Steps:**
1. I’ll check the SVG file structure to see if the “La Quiniela 247” text can be targeted with CSS.
2. I’ll update the three files to use the SVG, adjust sizes, and add the necessary CSS for light mode inversion.

Let’s start by inspecting the SVG file to confirm if the text can be targeted.

---

File seems to be binary and cannot be opened as text

---

It looks like the SVG file may be optimized or exported in a way that makes it unreadable as plain text (possibly a binary or minified format). 

To proceed with your requirements, I need to:
- Ensure the SVG has a distinct element (like a `<text>`, `<g>`, or a path with a class/id) for the “La Quiniela 247” text.
- If not, you may need to provide a version of the SVG where the “La Quiniela 247” text can be targeted with a class or id.

**Options:**
1. If you have the original SVG source, please upload or paste it as text so I can check and edit it for targeted CSS.
2. If not, I can proceed with the logo replacement and sizing, and leave a note in the code for the targeted inversion, pending a more accessible SVG.

Would you like to upload the SVG as text, or should I proceed with the replacement and sizing updates for now?

_**User**_

@logotipo-la-quiniela-247-min-2-1-1.png can you convert the attached .png to .svg for me?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can't directly convert a PNG image to SVG vector format in this environment, but I can guide you on how to do it and what to expect:

### Important Notes:
- **PNG to SVG conversion** is only truly effective if the image is simple (like flat logos or icons). Complex images or those with gradients, shadows, or many colors (like photos) do not convert well to SVG.
- The best SVGs are created from the original vector artwork (e.g., from Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or similar). Converting a raster PNG to SVG will result in a traced, less precise version.

### How to Convert PNG to SVG (Best Practices):

#### 1. **Online Tools (Quick & Easy)**
- Use a tool like [https://www.pngtosvg.com/](https://www.pngtosvg.com/) or [https://www.vectorizer.io/](https://www.vectorizer.io/)
- Upload your PNG, adjust the settings for best results, and download the SVG.

#### 2. **Using Vector Software (Best Quality)**
- Open the PNG in a vector graphics editor (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape - free).
- Use the “Image Trace” (Illustrator) or “Trace Bitmap” (Inkscape) feature.
- Clean up the result, separate elements (like the “La Quiniela 247” text), and save/export as SVG.
- You can then add classes or IDs to specific SVG elements for targeted CSS styling.

#### 3. **Manual Conversion (For Developers)**
- If you only need the logo as a static image and don’t need to edit individual elements, you can use the online tools above.
- If you want to target the “La Quiniela 247” text for color inversion, you’ll need to edit the SVG in a text editor and add a class or ID to that text/path.

### Next Steps for Your Project
1. **Convert the PNG to SVG** using one of the methods above.
2. **Edit the SVG** to add a class or ID to the “La Quiniela 247” text for CSS targeting.
3. **Upload the SVG** to your project and let me know, so I can help you with the code changes for color inversion and logo replacement.

If you need, I can provide a sample SVG structure and CSS for targeted inversion once you have the SVG file ready. Would you like a sample SVG template or further guidance on editing SVGs for targeted styling?

@logotipo-la-quiniela-247-min-2-1-1.svg per my last request here is the .svg file can you see it?

_**Assistant**_

Read file: frontend/public/logotipo-la-quiniela-247-min-2-1-1.svg

Yes, I can see and read the contents of your `logotipo-la-quiniela-247-min-2-1-1.svg` file.

**Analysis:**
- This SVG is actually a wrapper for a base64-encoded PNG image (it uses an `<image>` tag with a `data:image/png;base64,...` source).
- This means it is not a true vector SVG, but rather an SVG container for a raster image.
- As a result, you cannot target or style the “La Quiniela 247” text or any part of the logo with CSS, nor can you invert just the text color in light mode. Any color manipulation would affect the entire image, not just the text.

**What this means for your requests:**
- **Enlarging:** You can still enlarge the logo by adjusting the width/height of the SVG or the `<image>` inside it.
- **Color inversion (text only):** Not possible with this file, since the text is not a separate SVG element but part of the raster image.

**If you want to:**
- Target and style the “La Quiniela 247” text independently, you’ll need a true vector SVG where the text is a `<text>` or `<path>` element, not a raster image.

**Next steps/options:**
1. I can proceed to update your codebase to use this SVG (as a raster image) and adjust the sizing as you requested.
2. If you want targeted color inversion for the text, you’ll need to provide a vectorized SVG with editable text.

Would you like to proceed with the current SVG for sizing only, or do you want to try to obtain or create a true vector SVG for more advanced styling?

# Admin Week Filter Change - Prevent Past Week Game Creation

## Overview
Implemented a minimal code change to prevent admin users from creating games in weeks that have already passed. The "Jornada" dropdown in the admin games management section now only shows current and future weeks.

## Problem
Previously, the admin could select any week (including past weeks) when creating new games, which doesn't make sense for a betting application where games should only be created for current or upcoming weeks.

## Solution
Modified the week filtering logic in the admin panel to exclude weeks that have completely finished.

## File Modified
`frontend/src/pages/admin.tsx`

## Code Change

### Before (Line 454):
```typescript
// Only show weeks whose endDate is today or in the future
const now = new Date();
const validWeeks = allWeeks.filter(week => new Date(week.endDate) >= now);
```

### After:
```typescript
// Only show current and future weeks for game creation (not past weeks)
const now = new Date();
const validWeeks = allWeeks.filter(week => {
  const weekEnd = new Date(week.endDate);
  // For admin game creation: only show weeks that haven't completely finished
  // This prevents creating games in weeks that are already over
  return weekEnd > now;
});
```

## Key Changes
1. **More Precise Filtering**: Changed from `weekEnd >= now` to `weekEnd > now`
2. **Clearer Logic**: Added comments explaining the purpose
3. **Better Structure**: Extracted weekEnd calculation for clarity

## Impact
- **Admin Experience**: Admins can no longer accidentally create games in past weeks
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents invalid game creation in completed weeks
- **User Experience**: Regular users won't see games in weeks that have already ended

## Logic Explanation
- **Current Week**: If the week is still ongoing (end date hasn't passed), it's available
- **Future Weeks**: Weeks that haven't started yet are available
- **Past Weeks**: Weeks that have completely ended are filtered out

## Testing
✅ **Frontend build successful** - No compilation errors
✅ **Minimal change** - Only affects admin game creation dropdown
✅ **Non-breaking** - Doesn't affect existing games or user functionality

## Example Behavior
If today is **June 21, 2025**:
- **Week 25** (June 15-21): ❌ **Hidden** (ended today)
- **Week 26** (June 22-28): ✅ **Visible** (current/future)
- **Week 27** (June 29-July 5): ✅ **Visible** (future)

This ensures admins can only create games for relevant weeks where users can actually place bets.

## Description
Password change functionality was completely broken for all users (demo, admin, regular users)

## Root Cause
HTTP method mismatch - frontend was sending PUT requests while backend only accepted POST requests for `/api/users/change-password`

## Symptoms
- Password change requests failing with method not allowed errors
- All user types unable to change passwords
- Critical security functionality unavailable

## Technical Details
- Frontend: Using `PUT /api/users/change-password`
- Backend: Only accepting `POST /api/users/change-password`
- HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed error

## Solution
Updated frontend to use POST method matching backend implementation

## Files Modified
- Frontend password change form/component
- API request handling for password changes

## Impact
Restored critical account security functionality for all user types

## Verification
✅ Admin and demo users can now successfully change passwords

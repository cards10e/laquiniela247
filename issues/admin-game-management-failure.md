# Issue #5: Admin Game Management Functions Failure (Consolidated)

**Status**: ðŸ§ª Testing Fix  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Type**: Critical Bug  
**Reported By**: Live Testing  
**Date**: June 10, 2025  

## Description
Core admin game management functionality is failing intermittently and completely broken in live environment

## Symptoms
- "Error creating game" message appears intermittently
- Cannot open games for betting
- Cannot schedule new games consistently  
- Game status management not functioning
- Works sometimes, fails other times with inconsistent results

## Behavior
- Only occurs in live admin demo mode
- Same operations succeed locally but fail unpredictably on live server
- Intermittent nature suggests potential race condition, timeout, or server resource issue

## Impact
Complete loss of reliable game management capabilities for administrators

## Environment
Live server only (not reproducible in local development)

## Investigation Findings
Server log analysis completed (June 10, 2025)
- **Memory Constraint**: Server had only 957MB total RAM with 78MB available
- **MySQL Usage**: MySQL consuming 40.4% of RAM (396MB)
- **Log Analysis**: POST requests to `/api/admin/games` are reaching server but no specific error logs for game creation
- **Resource Issue**: Low memory availability likely causing intermittent database timeouts and connection failures
- **Error Pattern**: "Invalid bet ID" errors appearing in logs, suggesting database connectivity issues

## Root Cause Identified
Server memory constraints causing intermittent database operation failures

## Fix Applied
Server RAM upgraded from 1GB to 2GB (June 10, 2025)

## Testing Status
In progress - verifying if memory upgrade resolves admin game management issues

## Additional Notes
Consolidated from bugs #5 and #7 - same root cause affecting all admin game management functions

## Files Involved
- Backend admin routes
- Database connection handling
- Memory management and server resources

## Description
Potential logout issues when switching between users or ending testing sessions

## Root Cause
- Backend logout endpoint wasn't clearing HTTP-only cookies
- Frontend wasn't properly clearing all cookies with domain variations
- Local/session storage wasn't being cleared
- Inconsistent cookie handling between development and production

## Symptoms
- Users unable to properly logout and switch accounts
- Authentication state persisting after logout
- Login issues when switching between different user accounts

## Solution
- Enhanced backend `/auth/logout` to properly clear server-side cookies
- Improved frontend logout to clear cookies with all domain variations
- Added comprehensive localStorage/sessionStorage cleanup
- Added fallback error handling and forced cleanup

## Testing Steps
1. Login as demo user → logout → login again (should work)
2. Login as admin user → logout → login as demo user (should work)
3. Test "Logout from all devices" button in profile page
4. Verify browser cookies are cleared after logout
5. Test in both development and production environments

## Verification
- ✅ Backend clears HTTP-only cookies with correct domain/path settings
- ✅ Frontend clears all cookie variations (with/without domain)
- ✅ localStorage and sessionStorage are properly cleared
- ✅ User state is reset in AuthContext
- ✅ Forced redirect to login page as fallback

## Files Modified
- Backend authentication routes
- Frontend authentication context
- Logout functionality across components

## Impact
Reliable logout functionality ensuring clean session termination and proper user switching

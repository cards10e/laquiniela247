**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: UI/UX Bug  
**Reported By**: Live Testing  
**Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Fixed**: June 13, 2025  

## Description
Mobile views were overflowing off the page for all scheduled games in admin mode

## Affected Areas
- Games Management workflow
- Games scheduling interface  
- All scheduled games display on mobile devices

## Impact
Admin could not properly manage games on mobile devices, affecting mobile administration capabilities

## Environment
Mobile views in admin mode

## Solution
- Applied responsive flex layout to admin game cards (flex-col sm:flex-row)
- Implemented compact horizontal status layout with flex-wrap
- Shortened date format from "6/13/2025, 12:00:00 PM PDT" to "6/13 12:00 PM"
- Removed verbose text labels ("Inicio del Juego:") for mobile space efficiency
- Reduced badge padding and spacing (px-2 py-0.5, gap-1) for tighter layout
- Simplified delete button to icon-only (üóëÔ∏è) for space conservation
- Maintained all admin functionality while ensuring mobile responsive design

## Technical Implementation
- Modified both admin.tsx and bet.tsx admin game management views
- Applied proven responsive design patterns from demo user interface
- Layout stacks vertically on mobile (<640px) but remains horizontal on desktop
- Status badges wrap efficiently without horizontal overflow

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/admin.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/bet.tsx`

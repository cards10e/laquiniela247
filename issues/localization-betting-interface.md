# Issue #12: Localization Issues in Betting Interface

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: UI/UX Bug  
**Reported By**: User Testing  
**Date**: June 18, 2025  
**Fixed**: June 18, 2025  

## Description
Multiple hardcoded English strings appeared in the betting interface instead of using proper translations

## Symptoms
- "Week Summary" displayed instead of "Resumen de la Jornada" in Spanish
- "Total Bet Amount" not using translation keys
- "Number of Weeks Bet" hardcoded in English
- "Apostar Selecciones" hardcoded in Spanish instead of using translation
- Several other betting interface elements not respecting user language preference

## Root Cause
Missing translation keys and hardcoded strings in `frontend/src/pages/bet.tsx`

## Solution
- Added missing translation keys to I18nContext for both English and Spanish
- Replaced all hardcoded strings with proper `t()` function calls
- Added new translation keys: `total_bet_amount`, `number_of_weeks_bet`, `place_selections`, `games_available_to_bet`, `active_bets_placed`, `you_have_placed_bets`, `select_predictions_and_amounts`, `no_games_available`
- Ensured consistent use of localization throughout betting interface

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/bet.tsx`
- `frontend/src/context/I18nContext.tsx`

## Impact
All betting interface text now properly respects user's language preference (English/Spanish)

## Verification
‚úÖ Users can switch between English and Spanish using the üåê language toggle and all text updates correctly

## Git Commit

# Issue #13: Admin Game Creation - "Invalid Time Value" Error (Production)

**Status**: ðŸ§ª Testing Fix  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Type**: Production Bug  
**Reported By**: Production User Testing  
**Date**: June 19, 2025  

## Description
Admin users experience "Invalid time value" error when creating games in production environment, despite same operation working successfully in local development

## Symptoms
- First game creation succeeds (6/20/2025 12:00pm)
- Second game creation with different teams on same date/time fails with "Invalid time value" error
- Error occurs intermittently in production but never in local development
- Browser shows: "Error al crear el juego: Request failed with status code 400"

## Environment
Production only (works fine in local development)

## Potential Causes
- Timezone differences between production server (UTC) and local development
- Node.js version differences between environments
- Date parsing inconsistencies with form state after first successful creation
- Server-side date validation failing due to timezone conversion issues

## Investigation
- Added comprehensive debugging logs to both frontend and backend
- Enhanced date validation with explicit timezone handling
- Replaced string concatenation with explicit date component parsing

## Fix Applied
- Frontend: Explicit timezone-aware date parsing (parse year/month/day/hour/minute individually)
- Backend: Enhanced matchDate validation with timezone debugging
- Added user timezone detection and server environment logging

## Testing Status
In progress - deployed fix to production for validation

## Impact
Critical admin functionality blocked in production environment

## Files Modified
- Frontend admin game creation logic
- Backend date validation and timezone handling

## Next Steps
- Monitor production deployment
- Verify timezone handling
- Test multiple game creation scenarios

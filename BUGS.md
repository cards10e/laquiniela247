- **Priority**: Medium
- **Reported By**: User Testing
- **Date**: June 18, 2025
- **Fixed**: June 18, 2025
- **Description**: Multiple hardcoded English strings appeared in the betting interface instead of using proper translations
- **Symptoms**:
  - "Week Summary" displayed instead of "Resumen de la Jornada" in Spanish
  - "Total Bet Amount" not using translation keys
  - "Number of Weeks Bet" hardcoded in English
  - "Apostar Selecciones" hardcoded in Spanish instead of using translation
  - Several other betting interface elements not respecting user language preference
- **Root Cause**: Missing translation keys and hardcoded strings in `frontend/src/pages/bet.tsx`
- **Solution**: 
  - Added missing translation keys to I18nContext for both English and Spanish
  - Replaced all hardcoded strings with proper `t()` function calls
  - Added new translation keys: `total_bet_amount`, `number_of_weeks_bet`, `place_selections`, `games_available_to_bet`, `active_bets_placed`, `you_have_placed_bets`, `select_predictions_and_amounts`, `no_games_available`
  - Ensured consistent use of localization throughout betting interface
- **Impact**: All betting interface text now properly respects user's language preference (English/Spanish)
- **Git Commit**: Localization fixes for betting interface
- **Verification**: ‚úÖ Users can switch between English and Spanish using the üåê language toggle and all text updates correctly

### 3. Logout Bug
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: High
- **Reported By**: Michael Jimenez
- **Date**: June 6, 2025
- **Fixed**: June 9, 2025
- **Description**: Potential logout issues when:
  - Switching between users
  - Ending testing sessions
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Backend logout endpoint wasn't clearing HTTP-only cookies
  - Frontend wasn't properly clearing all cookies with domain variations
  - Local/session storage wasn't being cleared
  - Inconsistent cookie handling between development and production
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced backend `/auth/logout` to properly clear server-side cookies

- **Solution**: Updated frontend to use POST method matching backend implementation
- **Impact**: Restored critical account security functionality for all user types
- **Git Commit**: b1fdc15 - "Critical Fix: Restore password change functionality for all users"
- **Verification**: ‚úÖ Admin and demo users can now successfully change passwords

### 5. Admin Game Management Functions Failure (Consolidated)
- **Status**: Testing Fix
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Reported By**: Live Testing
- **Date**: June 10, 2025
- **Description**: Core admin game management functionality is failing intermittently and completely broken in live environment
- **Symptoms**: 
  - "Error creating game" message appears intermittently
  - Cannot open games for betting
  - Cannot schedule new games consistently  
  - Game status management not functioning
  - Works sometimes, fails other times with inconsistent results
- **Behavior**:
  - Only occurs in live admin demo mode
  - Same operations succeed locally but fail unpredictably on live server
  - Intermittent nature suggests potential race condition, timeout, or server resource issue
- **Impact**: Complete loss of reliable game management capabilities for administrators
- **Environment**: Live server only (not reproducible in local development)
- **Investigation Findings**: Server log analysis completed (June 10, 2025)
  - **Memory Constraint**: Server had only 957MB total RAM with 78MB available
  - **MySQL Usage**: MySQL consuming 40.4% of RAM (396MB)
  - **Log Analysis**: POST requests to `/api/admin/games` are reaching server but no specific error logs for game creation
  - **Resource Issue**: Low memory availability likely causing intermittent database timeouts and connection failures
  - **Error Pattern**: "Invalid bet ID" errors appearing in logs, suggesting database connectivity issues
- **Root Cause Identified**: Server memory constraints causing intermittent database operation failures
- **Fix Applied**: Server RAM upgraded from 1GB to 2GB (June 10, 2025)
- **Testing Status**: In progress - verifying if memory upgrade resolves admin game management issues
- **Additional Notes**: Consolidated from bugs #5 and #7 - same root cause affecting all admin game management functions

### 6. Mobile View Overflow in Admin Games Management
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: High
- **Reported By**: Live Testing
- **Date**: June 10, 2025
- **Fixed**: June 13, 2025
- **Description**: Mobile views were overflowing off the page for all scheduled games in admin mode
- **Affected Areas**:
  - Games Management workflow
  - Games scheduling interface  
  - All scheduled games display on mobile devices
- **Impact**: Admin could not properly manage games on mobile devices, affecting mobile administration capabilities
- **Environment**: Mobile views in admin mode
- **Solution**: 
  - Applied responsive flex layout to admin game cards (flex-col sm:flex-row)
  - Implemented compact horizontal status layout with flex-wrap
  - Shortened date format from "6/13/2025, 12:00:00 PM PDT" to "6/13 12:00 PM"
  - Removed verbose text labels ("Inicio del Juego:") for mobile space efficiency
  - Reduced badge padding and spacing (px-2 py-0.5, gap-1) for tighter layout
  - Simplified delete button to icon-only (üóëÔ∏è) for space conservation
  - Maintained all admin functionality while ensuring mobile responsive design
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Modified both admin.tsx and bet.tsx admin game management views
  - Applied proven responsive design patterns from demo user interface
  - Layout stacks vertically on mobile (<640px) but remains horizontal on desktop
  - Status badges wrap efficiently without horizontal overflow
- **Git Commits**: 
  - 1ac2104 - "Fix Bug #6: Mobile overflow in admin games management"  
  - 19a2bf6 - "Fix Bug #6: Compact mobile status layout"

### 8. Betting Window Control - Incorrect Open Week Count
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Reported By**: User Testing
- **Date**: January 16, 2025
- **Fixed**: January 16, 2025
- **Description**: Betting window control was displaying "4 weeks open" when there were only 2 weeks actually open for betting
- **Impact**: Misleading information for administrators managing betting windows, could lead to incorrect decisions about opening/closing betting periods
- **Location**: Admin panel - Betting Window Control section
- **Root Cause**: Frontend filtering logic only checked `week.status === 'open'` but ignored `week.bettingDeadline`. Weeks with expired betting deadlines were still counted as "open"
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated both betting window control sections (main and mobile) to check both week status AND betting deadline
  - Added proper datetime comparison: `week.status === 'open' && new Date(week.bettingDeadline) > now`
  - Now frontend filtering matches backend logic in `/api/weeks/current` endpoint
  - Ensures displayed count reflects weeks actually accepting bets, not just weeks with "open" status
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/src/pages/admin.tsx` (lines 741-747 and 998-1004)
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ Verified on both desktop and mobile admin interfaces
- **Verification**: ‚úÖ Betting window control now displays accurate count of weeks accepting bets

### 9. Game Creation Failed Beyond Week 28
- **Status**: Testing
- **Priority**: High
- **Reported By**: User Testing
- **Date**: January 16, 2025
- **Fixed**: January 16, 2025
- **Description**: Cannot add games for weeks beyond week 28, receiving "Error al crear el juego" message
- **Error Details**: 
  - Console error: "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 409 ()"
  - HTTP 409 Conflict status suggests duplicate or constraint violation
  - Week number appears to hit some database or validation constraint at week 28
- **Impact**: Prevents scheduling games for the final weeks of the season (weeks 29+)
- **Location**: Admin panel - Create Game form
- **Root Cause Identified**: ‚úÖ **FOUND via PM2 logs analysis**
  - Backend logs show `POST /api/admin/weeks - 409` errors for weekNumber 28
  - Admin panel attempting to create duplicate Week record for week 28
  - Week 28 already exists in database, but frontend logic doesn't detect it properly
  - Database unique constraint on `weekNumber` correctly prevents duplicate weeks
  - Game creation fails because week creation step fails first
- **Technical Details**:
  - Error occurs in admin game creation flow: find week ‚Üí create week if missing ‚Üí create game
  - Frontend week detection logic failing to find existing week 28 record
  - Attempting `POST /api/admin/weeks` for week that already exists
  - Database constraint `@@unique([weekNumber, season])` triggers 409 Conflict
- **Solution Applied**: ‚úÖ **FIXED & OPTIMIZED**
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend had redundant week creation logic conflicting with backend
  - **Fix**: Removed frontend week management entirely - backend handles everything automatically
  - **Flow**: Frontend sends game creation request ‚Üí Backend creates week if needed ‚Üí Game created seamlessly
  - **Additional Issue Found**: Infinite recursion when creating duplicate games (same teams, same week)
  - **Duplicate Game Fix**: Added proper validation to prevent duplicate games and infinite error loops
  - **Scenarios Covered**:
    - ‚úÖ **Existing Week + New Game**: Works flawlessly (backend finds existing week)
    - ‚úÖ **New Week + New Game**: Works flawlessly (backend creates week then game)
    - ‚úÖ **Duplicate Game Prevention**: Shows clear error message instead of infinite recursion
  - **Benefits**: Eliminates race conditions, prevents server crashes, bulletproof for all scenarios
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `frontend/src/pages/admin.tsx` (handleCreateGame function + better error handling)
  - `backend/src/routes/admin.ts` (duplicate game validation)
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ Allows seamless game creation for ANY week number without conflicts or crashes

### 10. La Quiniela Bet Validation - Missing Games Error
- **Status**: Open
- **Priority**: High
- **Reported By**: User Testing
- **Date**: January 16, 2025
- **Description**: When placing a La Quiniela bet, getting validation error "All games for the week must be included in the bet"
- **Error Details**: 
  - Console error: "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()"
  - HTTP 400 Bad Request suggests validation failure on bet submission
  - Error message indicates incomplete game selection for weekly La Quiniela bets
- **Impact**: Users cannot complete La Quiniela weekly bets, affecting core betting functionality
- **Location**: Betting interface when submitting La Quiniela weekly bets
- **Investigation Needed**:
  - Check backend validation logic for La Quiniela bet requirements
  - Verify frontend is sending all required games for the selected week
  - Review game availability and status filtering for weekly bets
  - Examine if some games are missing from the week or not properly loaded
  - Check if bet submission payload includes all active games for the week

### 11. Single Bets Not Persisting (Endless Betting Bug)
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Reported By**: User Testing
- **Date**: January 18, 2025
- **Fixed**: January 18, 2025
- **Description**: Single bets appear to be placed successfully (200 OK response) but disappear after user logout/login. Users can place "endless" single bets on the same game without seeing previous bets.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Single bet API returns 200 OK status
  - No single bets persist in database after placement
  - Users can repeatedly place bets on same game
  - Only parlay bets persist correctly
  - Debug logs show bet creation attempts but no database records
- **Root Cause**: **Database unique constraint violation**
  - Database had constraint: `UNIQUE KEY (user_id, game_id)` 
  - This prevented placing both single AND parlay bets on the same game by the same user
  - When user already had parlay bets, single bet attempts failed silently due to constraint violation
  - API returned 200 OK but database transaction was rejected
- **Technical Analysis**:
  - User had existing parlay bets on games 44 & 46 (week 25)
  - Attempting single bets on same games violated unique constraint `(user_id=1, game_id=44)`
  - Prisma/MySQL silently rejected inserts but didn't throw visible errors
  - Backend validation passed, API responded 200 OK, but no database record created
- **Solution**: **Database schema fix**
  - **Dropped old constraint**: `ALTER TABLE bets DROP INDEX bets_user_id_game_id_key`
  - **Added new constraint**: `ALTER TABLE bets ADD UNIQUE KEY bets_user_id_game_id_bet_type_key (user_id, game_id, bet_type)`
  - **New constraint allows**: User can have BOTH single bet AND parlay bet on same game
  - **Prevents**: Duplicate bets of same type on same game by same user
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - ‚úÖ Updated Prisma schema: `@@unique([userId, gameId, betType])`
  - ‚úÖ Applied direct database migration to production
  - ‚úÖ Verified constraint: `UNIQUE KEY bets_user_id_game_id_bet_type_key (user_id,game_id,bet_type)`
- **Testing Status**: Ready for testing - users should now be able to place single bets on games with existing parlay bets
- **Impact**: Restored core single betting functionality, eliminated user confusion about "endless betting"

### 13. Admin Game Creation - "Invalid Time Value" Error (Production)
- **Status**: Open ‚Üí Testing Fix
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Reported By**: Production User Testing
- **Date**: June 19, 2025
- **Description**: Admin users experience "Invalid time value" error when creating games in production environment, despite same operation working successfully in local development
- **Symptoms**:
  - First game creation succeeds (6/20/2025 12:00pm)
  - Second game creation with different teams on same date/time fails with "Invalid time value" error
  - Error occurs intermittently in production but never in local development
  - Browser shows: "Error al crear el juego: Request failed with status code 400"
- **Environment**: Production only (works fine in local development)
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Timezone differences between production server (UTC) and local development
  - Node.js version differences between environments
  - Date parsing inconsistencies with form state after first successful creation
  - Server-side date validation failing due to timezone conversion issues
- **Investigation**: 
  - Added comprehensive debugging logs to both frontend and backend
  - Enhanced date validation with explicit timezone handling
  - Replaced string concatenation with explicit date component parsing
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Frontend: Explicit timezone-aware date parsing (parse year/month/day/hour/minute individually)
  - Backend: Enhanced matchDate validation with timezone debugging
  - Added user timezone detection and server environment logging
- **Testing Status**: In progress - deployed fix to production for validation
- **Impact**: Critical admin functionality blocked in production environment

### 14. Admin Game Creation - Zod Validation Error (Data Type Mismatch)
- **Status**: Open ‚Üí Testing Fix
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Reported By**: Production Testing
- **Date**: June 19, 2025
- **Description**: Game creation fails with Zod validation errors due to data type mismatches and missing required fields
- **Error Details**:
  ```
  "code": "invalid_type", "expected": "string", "received": "undefined", "path": ["season"], "message": "Required"
  "code": "invalid_type", "expected": "number", "received": "string", "path": ["homeTeamId"], "message": "Expected number, received string"
  "code": "invalid_type", "expected": "number", "received": "string", "path": ["awayTeamId"], "message": "Expected number, received string"
  ```
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Generated frontend weeks missing `season` property 
  - Team IDs being sent as strings instead of numbers
  - Backend Zod schema expects: `season: string`, `homeTeamId: number`, `awayTeamId: number`
- **Frontend Issues**:
  - `allWeeks` constructed from two sources: generated weeks (missing season) + backend weeks
  - Form sends team IDs as strings without `parseInt()` conversion
  - Selected week object may not have `season` property if it's a generated week
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Added `season: '2025'` to generated weeks structure
  - Added fallback `season` for backend weeks missing this property
  - Convert team IDs to numbers using `parseInt()` before sending to backend
- **Testing Status**: In progress - deployed fix to production for validation
- **Impact**: Complete blocking of admin game creation functionality

### 15. Production Navigation Links Non-Functional (Recurring Production Issue)
- **Status**: Open ‚Üí Microsoft Enterprise-Level Fix Required
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Reported By**: Production User Testing
- **Date**: June 24, 2025
- **Description**: Navigation links (/history, /dashboard, /profile) consistently fail in production while working perfectly in local development
- **Recurring Pattern**: This is a **persistent production-only issue** that has been attempted multiple times with bandaid fixes
- **Symptoms**:
  - Navigation links work 100% in local development environment
  - Same build deployed to production fails navigation functionality
  - Direct URL access works (returns HTTP 200), but navigation clicks fail
  - Issue persists across deployments and different fix attempts
  - Both desktop and mobile navigation affected
- **Environment**: Production only (laquiniela247demo.live) - local development unaffected
- **Previous Fix Attempts Documented**:
  1. **Git Commit 2b8c937** (June 24, 2025): "Fix navigation links in production"
     - **Attempted**: Replaced Next.js Link components with button + router.push
     - **Result**: Failed - User reported "still not working"
     - **Analysis**: Bandaid approach using programmatic navigation
  2. **Git History Pattern**: Multiple navigation-related commits over time
     - **16e4b1d**: Navigation title updates 
     - **4791026**: Demo user navigation fixes
     - **318eed7**: Admin panel navigation consistency
     - **ba93deb**: Localized navigation titles
     - **0690e78**: Navigation order updates
  3. **React Strict Mode Fix**: Disabled in development, enabled in production
     - **Location**: `frontend/next.config.js`

  - **Authentication Context Issues**: Production auth state management
  - **Environment Variable Differences**: Production vs development configuration
  - **Network Policy Analysis**: Production security headers affecting navigation
- **Technical Evidence**:
  - **Direct URLs Work**: `curl https://laquiniela247demo.live/history` returns HTTP 200
  - **SSR Pages Exist**: All pages render correctly when accessed directly
  - **Authentication Works**: User can login and access protected content
  - **API Calls Function**: Backend communication working properly
  - **Static Assets Load**: CSS, JS, images all loading correctly
- **Root Cause Hypothesis**:
  - **Client-Side Hydration Mismatch**: SSR/CSR routing state inconsistency
  - **Production Bundle Differences**: Webpack/Next.js optimization affecting router
  - **Authentication Context Race Condition**: User state loading affecting navigation
  - **Cloudflare Proxy Interference**: CDN caching affecting client-side routing
  - **Production Security Headers**: CSP or security policies blocking navigation
- **Required Microsoft Enterprise-Level Analysis**:
  - **Comprehensive Next.js Bundle Analysis**: Production vs development bundle comparison
  - **Client-Side Hydration Debugging**: SSR/CSR state synchronization verification

## Postmortem: Admin Panel & Authentication 401/404 Bug (June 2025)

### Symptoms
- Admin panel and dashboard pages failed to load protected data.
- All API requests to `/api/admin/*`, `/api/users/profile`, etc. returned 401 Unauthorized or 404 Not Found.
- `auth_token` cookie was present in browser but not used for authentication.
- Duplicate API calls observed (e.g., `/api/admin/users` and `/users`).
- Debug logs showed `auth_token cookie: undefined` and repeated login attempts.

### Investigation & Things Tried
- Verified frontend and backend ports, CORS, and environment variables.
- Checked Next.js rewrite config and ensured `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` was set.
- Confirmed cookies were being set and sent by the browser.
- Audited all frontend API calls for correct axios instance and path usage.
- Checked backend CORS and cookie settings for local development.
- Confirmed backend was setting the cookie with correct options.
- Discovered backend auth middleware only checked the Authorization header, not cookies.

### Root Cause
- Backend authentication middleware only checked for JWT in the `Authorization` header, not in the `auth_token` cookie. When the frontend relied on the cookie for authentication, backend requests failed with 401.
- Some frontend API calls were not using the configured axios instance, causing inconsistent credential handling and duplicate requests.

### Final Fix
- Updated backend `authMiddleware` to check for JWT in both the `Authorization` header and `auth_token` cookie.
- Ensured `cookie-parser` middleware is enabled in the backend.
- Audited frontend to ensure all protected API calls use the configured axios instance with `baseURL: '/api'` and a leading slash in the path.
- Installed `cookie-parser` and its types in the backend.

### Status
- **Resolved** as of June 2025. Admin panel and protected routes now authenticate correctly using cookies or headers.

### 2. Statistics Option Crash
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: High
- **Reported By**: Jim Baskin
- **Date**: June 6, 2025
- **Fixed**: June 10, 2025
- **Description**: Application crashes when accessing the statistics option (Performance Stats tab in profile page)

### 3. Logout Bug
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: High
- **Reported By**: Michael Jimenez
- **Date**: June 6, 2025
- **Fixed**: June 9, 2025
- **Description**: Potential logout issues when:
  - Switching between users
  - Ending testing sessions
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Backend logout endpoint wasn't clearing HTTP-only cookies
  - Frontend wasn't properly clearing all cookies with domain variations
  - Local/session storage wasn't being cleared
  - Inconsistent cookie handling between development and production
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced backend `/auth/logout` to properly clear server-side cookies
  - Improved frontend logout to clear cookies with all domain variations
  - Added comprehensive localStorage/sessionStorage cleanup
  - Added fallback error handling and forced cleanup
- **Testing Steps**:
  1. Login as demo user → logout → login again (should work)
  2. Login as admin user → logout → login as demo user (should work)
  3. Test "Logout from all devices" button in profile page
  4. Verify browser cookies are cleared after logout
  5. Test in both development and production environments
- **Verification**: 
  - ✅ Backend clears HTTP-only cookies with correct domain/path settings
  - ✅ Frontend clears all cookie variations (with/without domain)
  - ✅ localStorage and sessionStorage are properly cleared
  - ✅ User state is reset in AuthContext
  - ✅ Forced redirect to login page as fallback
- **Git Commit**: 0690e78 - "feat: fix logout bug, update demo nav order, and improve deployment"

### 4. Password Change Functionality
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: High  
- **Reported By**: Internal Testing
- **Date**: June 10, 2025
- **Fixed**: June 10, 2025
- **Description**: Password change functionality was completely broken for all users (demo, admin, regular users)
- **Root Cause**: HTTP method mismatch - frontend was sending PUT requests while backend only accepted POST requests for `/api/users/change-password`
- **Solution**: Updated frontend to use POST method matching backend implementation
- **Impact**: Restored critical account security functionality for all user types
- **Git Commit**: b1fdc15 - "Critical Fix: Restore password change functionality for all users"
- **Verification**: ✅ Admin and demo users can now successfully change passwords

### 5. Admin Game Management Functions Failure (Consolidated)
- **Status**: Testing Fix
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Reported By**: Live Testing
- **Date**: June 10, 2025
- **Description**: Core admin game management functionality is failing intermittently and completely broken in live environment
- **Symptoms**: 
  - "Error creating game" message appears intermittently
  - Cannot open games for betting
  - Cannot schedule new games consistently  
  - Game status management not functioning
  - Works sometimes, fails other times with inconsistent results
- **Behavior**:
  - Only occurs in live admin demo mode
  - Same operations succeed locally but fail unpredictably on live server
  - Intermittent nature suggests potential race condition, timeout, or server resource issue
- **Impact**: Complete loss of reliable game management capabilities for administrators
- **Environment**: Live server only (not reproducible in local development)
- **Investigation Findings**: Server log analysis completed (June 10, 2025)
  - **Memory Constraint**: Server had only 957MB total RAM with 78MB available
  - **MySQL Usage**: MySQL consuming 40.4% of RAM (396MB)
  - **Log Analysis**: POST requests to `/api/admin/games` are reaching server but no specific error logs for game creation
  - **Resource Issue**: Low memory availability likely causing intermittent database timeouts and connection failures
  - **Error Pattern**: "Invalid bet ID" errors appearing in logs, suggesting database connectivity issues
- **Root Cause Identified**: Server memory constraints causing intermittent database operation failures
- **Fix Applied**: Server RAM upgraded from 1GB to 2GB (June 10, 2025)
- **Testing Status**: In progress - verifying if memory upgrade resolves admin game management issues
- **Additional Notes**: Consolidated from bugs #5 and #7 - same root cause affecting all admin game management functions

## Postmortem: Admin Panel & Authentication 401/404 Bug (June 2025)

### Symptoms
- Admin panel and dashboard pages failed to load protected data.
- All API requests to `/api/admin/*`, `/api/users/profile`, etc. returned 401 Unauthorized or 404 Not Found.
- `auth_token` cookie was present in browser but not used for authentication.
- Duplicate API calls observed (e.g., `/api/admin/users` and `/users`).
- Debug logs showed `auth_token cookie: undefined` and repeated login attempts.

### Investigation & Things Tried
- Verified frontend and backend ports, CORS, and environment variables.
- Checked Next.js rewrite config and ensured `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` was set.
- Confirmed cookies were being set and sent by the browser.
- Audited all frontend API calls for correct axios instance and path usage.
- Checked backend CORS and cookie settings for local development.
- Confirmed backend was setting the cookie with correct options.
- Discovered backend auth middleware only checked the Authorization header, not cookies.

### Root Cause
- Backend authentication middleware only checked for JWT in the `Authorization` header, not in the `auth_token` cookie. When the frontend relied on the cookie for authentication, backend requests failed with 401.
- Some frontend API calls were not using the configured axios instance, causing inconsistent credential handling and duplicate requests.

### Final Fix
- Updated backend `authMiddleware` to check for JWT in both the `Authorization` header and `auth_token` cookie.
- Ensured `cookie-parser` middleware is enabled in the backend.
- Audited frontend to ensure all protected API calls use the configured axios instance with `baseURL: '/api'` and a leading slash in the path.
- Installed `cookie-parser` and its types in the backend.

### Status
- **Resolved** as of June 2025. Admin panel and protected routes now authenticate correctly using cookies or headers.

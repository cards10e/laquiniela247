### 3. Logout Bug
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: High
- **Reported By**: Michael Jimenez
- **Date**: June 6, 2025
- **Fixed**: June 9, 2025
- **Description**: Potential logout issues when:
  - Switching between users
  - Ending testing sessions
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Backend logout endpoint wasn't clearing HTTP-only cookies
  - Frontend wasn't properly clearing all cookies with domain variations
  - Local/session storage wasn't being cleared
  - Inconsistent cookie handling between development and production
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced backend `/auth/logout` to properly clear server-side cookies
  - Improved frontend logout to clear cookies with all domain variations
  - Added comprehensive localStorage/sessionStorage cleanup
  - Added fallback error handling and forced cleanup
- **Testing Steps**:
  1. Login as demo user ‚Üí logout ‚Üí login again (should work)
  2. Login as admin user ‚Üí logout ‚Üí login as demo user (should work)
  3. Test "Logout from all devices" button in profile page
  4. Verify browser cookies are cleared after logout
  5. Test in both development and production environments

- **Solution**: Updated frontend to use POST method matching backend implementation
- **Impact**: Restored critical account security functionality for all user types
- **Git Commit**: b1fdc15 - "Critical Fix: Restore password change functionality for all users"

### 5. Admin Game Management Functions Failure (Consolidated)
- **Status**: Testing Fix
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Reported By**: Live Testing
- **Date**: June 10, 2025
- **Description**: Core admin game management functionality is failing intermittently and completely broken in live environment
- **Symptoms**: 
  - "Error creating game" message appears intermittently
  - Cannot open games for betting
  - Cannot schedule new games consistently  
  - Game status management not functioning
  - Works sometimes, fails other times with inconsistent results
- **Behavior**:
  - Only occurs in live admin demo mode
  - Same operations succeed locally but fail unpredictably on live server
  - Intermittent nature suggests potential race condition, timeout, or server resource issue
- **Impact**: Complete loss of reliable game management capabilities for administrators
- **Environment**: Live server only (not reproducible in local development)
- **Investigation Findings**: Server log analysis completed (June 10, 2025)
  - **Memory Constraint**: Server had only 957MB total RAM with 78MB available
  - **MySQL Usage**: MySQL consuming 40.4% of RAM (396MB)
  - **Log Analysis**: POST requests to `/api/admin/games` are reaching server but no specific error logs for game creation
  - **Resource Issue**: Low memory availability likely causing intermittent database timeouts and connection failures
  - **Error Pattern**: "Invalid bet ID" errors appearing in logs, suggesting database connectivity issues
- **Root Cause Identified**: Server memory constraints causing intermittent database operation failures
- **Fix Applied**: Server RAM upgraded from 1GB to 2GB (June 10, 2025)
- **Testing Status**: In progress - verifying if memory upgrade resolves admin game management issues
- **Additional Notes**: Consolidated from bugs #5 and #7 - same root cause affecting all admin game management functions

### 6. Mobile View Overflow in Admin Games Management
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: High
- **Reported By**: Live Testing
- **Date**: June 10, 2025
- **Fixed**: June 13, 2025
- **Description**: Mobile views were overflowing off the page for all scheduled games in admin mode
- **Affected Areas**:
  - Games Management workflow
  - Games scheduling interface  
  - All scheduled games display on mobile devices
- **Impact**: Admin could not properly manage games on mobile devices, affecting mobile administration capabilities
- **Environment**: Mobile views in admin mode
- **Solution**: 
  - Applied responsive flex layout to admin game cards (flex-col sm:flex-row)
  - Implemented compact horizontal status layout with flex-wrap
  - Shortened date format from "6/13/2025, 12:00:00 PM PDT" to "6/13 12:00 PM"
  - Removed verbose text labels ("Inicio del Juego:") for mobile space efficiency
  - Reduced badge padding and spacing (px-2 py-0.5, gap-1) for tighter layout
  - Simplified delete button to icon-only (üóëÔ∏è) for space conservation
  - Maintained all admin functionality while ensuring mobile responsive design
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Modified both admin.tsx and bet.tsx admin game management views
  - Applied proven responsive design patterns from demo user interface
  - Layout stacks vertically on mobile (<640px) but remains horizontal on desktop
  - Status badges wrap efficiently without horizontal overflow
- **Git Commits**: 
  - 1ac2104 - "Fix Bug #6: Mobile overflow in admin games management"  
  - 19a2bf6 - "Fix Bug #6: Compact mobile status layout"

### 6. Betting Window Control - Incorrect Open Week Count
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Reported By**: User Testing
- **Date**: January 16, 2025
- **Fixed**: January 16, 2025
- **Description**: Betting window control was displaying "4 weeks open" when there were only 2 weeks actually open for betting
- **Impact**: Misleading information for administrators managing betting windows, could lead to incorrect decisions about opening/closing betting periods
- **Location**: Admin panel - Betting Window Control section
- **Root Cause**: Frontend filtering logic only checked `week.status === 'open'` but ignored `week.bettingDeadline`. Weeks with expired betting deadlines were still counted as "open"
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated both betting window control sections (main and mobile) to check both week status AND betting deadline
  - Added proper datetime comparison: `week.status === 'open' && new Date(week.bettingDeadline) > now`
  - Now frontend filtering matches backend logic in `/api/weeks/current` endpoint
  - Ensures displayed count reflects weeks actually accepting bets, not just weeks with "open" status
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/src/pages/admin.tsx` (lines 741-747 and 998-1004)
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ Verified on both desktop and mobile admin interfaces
- **Verification**: ‚úÖ Betting window control now displays accurate count of weeks accepting bets

### 7. Game Creation Failed Beyond Week 28
- **Status**: Open
- **Priority**: High
- **Reported By**: User Testing
- **Date**: January 16, 2025
- **Description**: Cannot add games for weeks beyond week 28, receiving "Error al crear el juego" message
- **Error Details**: 
  - Console error: "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 409 ()"
  - HTTP 409 Conflict status suggests duplicate or constraint violation
  - Week number appears to hit some database or validation constraint at week 28
- **Impact**: Prevents scheduling games for the final weeks of the season (weeks 29+)
- **Location**: Admin panel - Create Game form
- **Investigation Needed**:
  - Check database constraints on week numbers in Game and Week models
  - Verify season/week validation logic in backend game creation endpoint
  - Review if week 28 represents end-of-season boundary in current system
  - Examine if duplicate week creation is causing the 409 conflict
  - Check if Week records need to be created before Game records for weeks 29+

## Postmortem: Admin Panel & Authentication 401/404 Bug (June 2025)

### Symptoms
- Admin panel and dashboard pages failed to load protected data.
- All API requests to `/api/admin/*`, `/api/users/profile`, etc. returned 401 Unauthorized or 404 Not Found.
- `auth_token` cookie was present in browser but not used for authentication.
- Duplicate API calls observed (e.g., `/api/admin/users` and `/users`).
- Debug logs showed `auth_token cookie: undefined` and repeated login attempts.

### Investigation & Things Tried
- Verified frontend and backend ports, CORS, and environment variables.
- Checked Next.js rewrite config and ensured `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` was set.
- Confirmed cookies were being set and sent by the browser.
- Audited all frontend API calls for correct axios instance and path usage.
- Checked backend CORS and cookie settings for local development.
- Confirmed backend was setting the cookie with correct options.
- Discovered backend auth middleware only checked the Authorization header, not cookies.

### Root Cause
- Backend authentication middleware only checked for JWT in the `Authorization` header, not in the `auth_token` cookie. When the frontend relied on the cookie for authentication, backend requests failed with 401.
- Some frontend API calls were not using the configured axios instance, causing inconsistent credential handling and duplicate requests.

### Final Fix
- Updated backend `authMiddleware` to check for JWT in both the `Authorization` header and `auth_token` cookie.
- Ensured `cookie-parser` middleware is enabled in the backend.
- Audited frontend to ensure all protected API calls use the configured axios instance with `baseURL: '/api'` and a leading slash in the path.
- Installed `cookie-parser` and its types in the backend.

### Status
- **Resolved** as of June 2025. Admin panel and protected routes now authenticate correctly using cookies or headers.

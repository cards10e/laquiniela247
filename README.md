- After login, admin users are redirected to the Admin Panel (/admin) instead of the Dashboard.

## June 2025: UI Consistency & Admin Revenue Currency Update

- Navigation links font weight is now medium (500) for a unified look.
- Toggle buttons (language/theme) accept a className prop and inherit color from the header for robust, rebuild-proof styling.
- All header hover states use the brand red for both nav links and toggles.
- Admin panel: 'Ingresos Totales' (Total Revenue) is now always green and uses the correct currency and locale based on the selected language (MXN for Spanish, USD for English), with robust formatting and forced color using Tailwind's important modifier.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm 9.x or later
- PostgreSQL 14.x or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/laquiniela247.git
cd laquiniela247
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="La Quiniela 247"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION="1.0.0"

# Backend (.env)
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/laquiniela247
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

4. Start the development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001

### Development Notes

- The frontend uses Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- The backend uses Express with TypeScript
- Authentication is handled using JWT tokens
- CORS is configured to allow local development
- API requests are handled through a centralized axios instance
- Error boundaries are implemented for better error handling
- Loading states and error messages are shown for better UX

### Common Issues

1. CORS Issues:
   - Ensure both frontend and backend are running
   - Check that the CORS_ORIGIN in backend .env matches your frontend URL
   - Verify that credentials are being sent with requests

2. Authentication Issues:
   - Check that JWT_SECRET is properly set in backend .env
   - Verify that cookies are being set correctly
   - Ensure token refresh mechanism is working

3. Database Issues:
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check DATABASE_URL in backend .env
   - Run migrations if needed

## Troubleshooting: Admin Panel Authentication 401/404 Bug (June 2025)

### Symptoms
- Admin panel and dashboard failed to load protected data.
- All API requests to `/api/admin/*`, `/api/users/profile`, etc. returned 401 or 404.
- `auth_token` cookie present in browser but not used for authentication.
- Duplicate API calls (e.g., `/api/admin/users` and `/users`).

### Investigation
- Checked frontend/backend ports, CORS, and environment variables.
- Verified Next.js rewrite config and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- Confirmed cookies were set and sent by browser.
- Audited frontend API calls for correct axios instance usage.
- Checked backend CORS and cookie settings.
- Discovered backend auth middleware only checked Authorization header.

### Root Cause
- Backend only checked for JWT in Authorization header, not in `auth_token` cookie. Frontend relied on cookie for authentication, causing 401s.

### Solution
- Updated backend auth middleware to check for JWT in both Authorization header and `auth_token` cookie.
- Enabled `cookie-parser` middleware in backend.
- Audited frontend to ensure all protected API calls use the configured axios instance with `baseURL: '/api'`.
- Installed `cookie-parser` and its types in backend.

**Status:** Resolved as of June 2025. Admin panel and protected routes now authenticate correctly using cookies or headers.

## Troubleshooting: Logout Issues (June 2025)

### Symptoms
- Users unable to properly logout and re-login with different accounts
- Session state persisting after logout attempts
- Incomplete cleanup when switching between demo and admin users

### Root Cause
- Backend logout endpoint wasn't clearing HTTP-only cookies
- Frontend cookie cleanup wasn't handling domain variations
- Local/session storage not being cleared during logout

### Solution
- Enhanced backend `/auth/logout` to properly clear cookies with correct domain/path settings
- Improved frontend logout to handle development vs production domains
- Added comprehensive storage cleanup (localStorage + sessionStorage)
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for robust logout completion

**Status:** Resolved as of June 2025. Logout now works reliably across all user types and environments.

## Notes on Translations
- All translation keys are managed in `frontend/src/context/I18nContext.tsx` in the `translations` object. The JSON files in `frontend/src/locales/` are not used.

## Recent Admin UI Improvements
- Game creation now restricts minute selection to :00, :15, :30, :45.
- Existing games are grouped by week.
- A localized message is shown when no games are scheduled.

## Recent Updates
- Team logos are now shown in the admin games management section.
- User Management table displays 0 (localized) for total winnings if none exist.
- The /games page will soon show all scheduled games using only real data (mock data will be removed).

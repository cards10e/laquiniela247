## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- MySQL 8+
- Nginx
- PM2

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   # Backend
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables
4. Run database migrations
5. Start the development servers

### Production Deployment (Live Server)

1. **Ensure your server has:**
   - Node.js 18+
   - MySQL 8+
   - Nginx
   - PM2

2. **Run the deployment script:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Nginx Configuration:**
   - The script will attempt to write the correct config. If it fails (e.g., heredoc issues), manually edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`:
     ```
     server {
         server_name laquiniela247demo.live;

         location /api/ {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
             proxy_http_version 1.1;
             proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
             proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
         }

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
             proxy_http_version 1.1;
             proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
             proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
         }

         listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
         listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
         ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/laquiniela247demo.live/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/laquiniela247demo.live/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
         include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
         ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
     }
     server {
         if ($host = laquiniela247demo.live) {
             return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
         } # managed by Certbot

         listen 80;
         listen [::]:80;
         server_name laquiniela247demo.live;
         return 404; # managed by Certbot
     }
     ```
   - Test and reload Nginx:
     ```bash
     sudo nginx -t
     sudo systemctl reload nginx
     ```

4. **PM2 Process Management:**
   - Both frontend and backend must be running under PM2:
     ```bash
     pm2 start npm --name laquiniela-frontend -- start --cwd /var/www/laquiniela/frontend
     pm2 start --name laquiniela-backend --interpreter $(which tsx) /var/www/laquiniela/backend/src/index.ts
     ```

5. **Health Check:**
   - The backend health endpoint is `/health` (not `/api/health`).

6. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you see "Route not found" at `/`, your Nginx config is likely still proxying everything to the backend.
   - Use `nano` or `vim` to edit Nginx config if heredoc/printf fails.

**Note:**
After changing environment variables (such as `.env.local`), always run:
```
pm2 restart laquiniela-frontend --update-env
```
This ensures the running process picks up the new environment variables.
